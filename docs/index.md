# Documentation Stack — homemade-claude-kit

> **Scaffolded:** 2026-07-20 · **Last refreshed:** 2026-07-20
>
> Run the Scaffold mode Mode 3 to refresh status.
> Run the Audit mode Mode 2 for a full progress snapshot.
>
> This is the OKF bundle root `index.md` (reserved file — no artefact frontmatter).

> **Note on this repo.** `homemade-claude-kit` is the skill kit itself, not a product built
> through its own full business-strategy spine — it carries a **`VISION.md`** (its north
> star as a harness-agnostic toolkit) but no personas, BMC, or capability map of its own, so
> Steps 1–10 below remain legitimately ⬜. What this repo actually dogfoods is the
> **open-items governance system** (`docs/project-control/open-items/`, github backend) and
> the **use-case registry** (`docs/product-specs/use-cases/issues-management/`, 11 UCs). Its Architecture
> Decision Records (9) and research notes (3) are also live and current.

**Summary:** ✅ 3 / 🔄 0 / ⬜ 13 of 16 artefact steps

**Next step:** this repo does not run its full business-strategy spine (see note above) — Step 0 (Vision) is now live, but Steps 1–10 are deliberately skipped for a toolkit rather than a product. The live work surfaces are `docs/VISION.md`, the open-items ledger, and the use-case registry.
