description: "Create a Delivery Roadmap — the Plan by Feature artefact that groups FBS functionalities into named, scoped, priority-ordered epics (E-NN), defines the MVP walking skeleton (minimum end-to-end journey), and declares per-phase goals expressed as value streams made operational. Bridges FBS (what the product does), value streams (how value flows), and PRDs (what we build next). Serves simultaneously as delivery planning tool (E-NN clusters, FBS scope, PRD links) and product roadmap (phase goals, walking skeleton, business narrative). For a solo founder or small team, one document serves both audiences. Triggers on: delivery roadmap, epic catalogue, epic list, plan by feature, group features into epics, define epics, epic planning, feature grouping, epic scope, what PRDs to write, product roadmap, phase plan, MVP slice, walking skeleton, release plan, what do we build next."

# Delivery Roadmap Builder

You are an expert at producing **Delivery Roadmaps** — the artefact that
answers two questions simultaneously:

1. **Delivery planning (team-facing):** "Given everything in the FBS, what
   clusters together into coherent delivery units, and in what order do we
   build them?" → E-NN epics with stable IDs, FBS scope lists, PRD links.

2. **Product roadmap (stakeholder-facing):** "What does the product deliver
   at each milestone, and what can users actually DO after each phase ships?"
   → Walking Skeleton (MVP) and per-phase goal statements expressed as value
   streams made operational.

For a solo founder or small team, one document serves both audiences. When
audiences diverge (investors vs developers), extract a stakeholder copy —
the delivery roadmap remains the source of truth.

The artefact lives at `docs/product-specs/08a-delivery-roadmap.md`.

## The two layers in one document

The §Walking Skeleton and §Phase Plan speak in business language (personas,
outcomes, value streams). The §Epic Table and §Per-epic sections speak in
delivery language (E-NN, C-N.M.FXX, QA-XXNN). Same document, two registers.

---

## What an epic is

**Is:** a named cluster of FBS functionalities that delivers recognisable
value to a specific persona when complete; specified in a single PRD;
has a stable E-NN ID.

**Is not:** a capability (BC Map), a user story (PRD), a sprint
(implementation plan), or a value stream (value stream doc).

**Sizing:** 5–25 FBS functionalities, 2–8 weeks of focused development.
Differentiator (★) functionalities always anchor their own epic.

---

## What a walking skeleton is

A walking skeleton is a **horizontal slice across multiple epics** that makes
one complete value stream operational end-to-end. It is:

- The minimum set of functionalities from multiple epics that allows the
  primary persona to complete one end-to-end journey without workarounds
- Defined by a value stream (VS-N), NOT by an epic boundary
- The hypothesis-test vehicle for the core product value proposition

It is NOT:
- A vertical completion of any single epic
- The minimum possible feature
- An internal prototype

**Walking skeleton ≠ MVP:** conceptually identical here. Both mean the
minimum deployable product that validates the primary hypothesis with a
real user on a real workflow.

**Coverage rule:** every VS stage of the target value stream must have
≥ 1 functionality in the walking skeleton. If any stage is uncovered,
the persona cannot complete the journey — the skeleton is broken.

---

## Mode — Generate (single mode, full output)

### Step 0 — Read all upstream artefacts

```bash
cat docs/VISION.md 2>/dev/null                                     # optional: read if exists — phase goals should connect to vision north star
cat docs/product-specs/07a-fbs.md
cat docs/business/04a-value-streams.md
cat docs/business/01a-personas.md
cat docs/product-specs/09a-quality-attributes.md                   # optional
```

**From FBS extract:**
- Every C-N.M.FXX with VS stage link, phase tag (Phase 1/2/3), ★ marker
- Total count by phase

**From value streams extract:**
- Pain index per VS stage (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- Triggering persona per VS
- Value proposition per VS (vocabulary for phase goal statements)

**From personas extract:**
- P-NN name and role (for "what P-NN can do" narrative)
- Primary device + usage context (for walking skeleton framing)

### Step 1 — Group FBS into epics

Apply these heuristics in order:

1. **VS stage affinity** — functionalities with the same VS stage link
   cluster together. Functionalities with `—` attach to the most
   contextually relevant capability domain epic.

2. **Capability domain coherence** — within a VS stage group, check
   whether functionalities span multiple L0 domains. If they span
   configuration domains (C1 + C2), they may form one setup epic.

3. **Differentiator anchoring** — any ★ functionality anchors its own
   epic. Never merge a ★ into a secondary epic.

4. **Phase boundary** — Phase 2 functionalities always form separate
   epics from Phase 1 functionalities.

5. **Sizing check** — < 5 rows: consider merging. > 25 rows: split by
   VS stage or capability boundary.

### Step 2 — Name each epic

Name after the **value delivered**, not the features implemented.
Test: "When this epic ships, [persona] can [outcome]."

| ❌ Feature-oriented | ✅ Value-oriented |
|---|---|
| "Configuration Module" | "Clinic & Workforce Configuration" |
| "Schedule Algorithm" | "Semester Schedule Generation" |
| "Notifications" | "Surgeon Confirmation Loop" |

### Step 3 — Order by priority

1. Critical pain stages first
2. High pain stages next
3. Prerequisites (setup/config epics) before features they enable
4. Same pain level → Phase 1 before Phase 2

Assign E-NN IDs in priority order. IDs are **permanent** — never recycled.

### Step 4 — Define the Walking Skeleton

1. **Identify the primary VS to validate** — the one with the most
   Critical-pain stages whose end-to-end completion proves the core
   hypothesis.

2. **Select the minimum functionalities per epic** needed to cover
   every stage of that VS. This is a horizontal cut — not epic
   completion.

3. **Run the coverage check** — every VS stage of the target VS must
   have ≥ 1 functionality in the cut. Flag any uncovered stage.

4. **Write the "can / cannot yet" statement** — what the primary
   persona can accomplish after the walking skeleton ships, and what
   is explicitly deferred to Phase 1 completion.

### Step 5 — Define the Phase Plan

For each phase:
- **Which epics are complete**
- **Which value streams become fully operational** — meaning all their
  stages are covered by shipped functionalities. Not "partially" — fully.
- **One-sentence goal** completing: "After this phase, [P-NN] can
  [end-to-end outcome] without [current workaround]."

### Step 6 — Write the delivery roadmap

Produce the full document per the output structure below.

### Step 7 — Coverage check

Verify every Phase 1 FBS functionality appears in exactly one epic:

```bash
grep -o "C[0-9]\.[0-9]\.F[0-9][0-9]" \
  docs/product-specs/08a-delivery-roadmap.md | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

Compare to Phase 1 FBS total. Flag orphaned functionalities.

## Walking Skeleton — MVP

**Hypothesis to validate:** [core product assumption — one sentence]
**Value stream delivered end-to-end:** [VS-N · Name](link) — Pain: Critical

| Epic | MVP functionalities | Deferred to Phase 1 |
|---|---|---|
| E-NN | C-N.M.FXX · … | [what is skipped and why] |

**After MVP ships, [P-NN] can:**
1. [Concrete action 1]
2. [Concrete action 2]
…

**After MVP ships, [P-NN] cannot yet:**
- [Deferred capability] → Phase 1 (E-NN complete)

---

## Phase Plan

| Phase | Epics | Value streams fully operational | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MVP** | E-NN (partial) … | VS-N (thin slice) | [outcome sentence without current workaround] |
| **Phase 1** | E-01 → E-NN complete | VS-N · VS-M · VS-P | [outcome sentence] |
| **Phase 2** | + E-NN | + VS-Q | [outcome sentence] |
| **Phase 3** | [TBD] | [TBD] | [outcome sentence] |

## Epic Table

| ID | Epic name | VS anchor | Pain | Personas | Capabilities | FBS rows | Phase | PRD | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-01 | … | [VS-N.M](link) | Critical | [P-NN](link) | [C-N.M](link) | N | 1 | _TODO_ | ⬜ |

## Epics

### E-01 · [Name]

**Value statement:** When this epic ships, [P-NN] can [outcome].
**Objective:** [OBJ-NN · Objective title](link to objectives.md) *(if objectives doc exists)*
**VS anchor:** [VS-N.M · Stage name](link) — Pain: Critical / High / Medium
**Personas:** [P-NN](link)
**Capabilities:** [C-N.M](link to BC Map)
**Phase:** Phase N
**PRD:** _TODO_
**Quality attributes in scope:** [QA-XXNN] (if QA doc exists)
**Sizing:** N functionalities — within / below / above range (5–25)

**FBS scope:**

| ID | Functionality | Status |
|---|---|---|

## Epic ID convention

`E-NN` — two-digit zero-padded, assigned in priority order, permanent.
Retired epics: marked ❌ with a note; row preserved, ID not reused.
PRDs reference epics as `E-NN · [name]` in §0 Architecture Traceability.

---

## Discipline checks

Before declaring complete:

- [ ] Every Phase 1 FBS functionality in exactly one epic (coverage check run)
- [ ] Walking skeleton covers every stage of target VS end-to-end (no broken stages)
- [ ] "Cannot yet" block is explicit — no false completeness in MVP framing
- [ ] Every epic has a value statement ("when this ships, P-NN can…")
- [ ] Every epic references ≥1 OBJ-NN (when objectives doc exists at `docs/business/04b-objectives.md`)
- [ ] Phase goals express VS streams operational, not feature lists
- [ ] Differentiator (★) functionalities each anchor their own epic
- [ ] E-NN IDs in pain-index priority order (Critical before High before Medium)
- [ ] Sizing within 5–25 FBS rows per epic (outliers flagged)
- [ ] Phase 2 epics listed after all Phase 1 epics

## Cross-references

| Reads | Why |
|---|---|
| FBS (`C-N.M.FXX` + VS stage + phase + ★) | Primary input — every functionality lands in an epic |
| Value streams (`VS-N.M` pain index + value proposition per VS) | Epic priority + phase goal vocabulary |
| Personas (`P-NN` device + context) | Walking skeleton "can/cannot yet" narrative |
| Quality attributes (`QA-XXNN`) | Optional — which QA entries apply per epic scope |
| Business objectives (`OBJ-NN` + `KR-NN.M`) | Optional — epics reference `OBJ-NN` in value statement; traceability matrix links each E-NN to the objective it serves |

| Feeds | How |
|---|---|
| PRDs | One PRD per epic; PRD §0 references `E-NN` + FBS scope list |
| Implementation plans | Via PRD → epic chain |
| ADRs | Architectural decisions reference which epics they unblock |
