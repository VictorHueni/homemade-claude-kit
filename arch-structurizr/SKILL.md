# Structurizr workspace + render pipeline

This is the **foundation** for every C4 / arc42-architecture diagram the kit produces. It scaffolds the Structurizr DSL workspace and the two-stage Docker render pipeline. After `init` runs once, the `arch-c4` skill edits `workspace.dsl` going forward; `arch-structurizr` does not author C4 model elements itself.

## Why two skills instead of one

| Skill | Role | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| `arch-structurizr` | One-time scaffold: filesystem layout, pinned Docker versions, render script, conventions. | Once per project (re-run only on `upgrade`). |
| `arch-c4` | Per-view authoring: adds people, systems, containers, components, deployment nodes; runs `render.sh`; embeds SVGs into arc42 §3/§5/§7 markdown. | Many times — every time the architecture evolves. |

## Output the skill produces

```
docs/architecture/c4/
├── workspace.dsl        ← Structurizr DSL — single source of truth
├── render.sh            ← Single-image Docker pipeline (executable)
├── README.md            ← How to render locally; pinned version; view aliases
└── views/               ← Rendered SVGs (committed)
    └── .gitkeep
```

The skill does **not** create any arc42 markdown — that is `arch-c4`'s job.

## Pipeline (read this before editing render.sh)

The consolidated [Structurizr vNext](https://www.patreon.com/posts/introducing-146923136) tool exports SVG directly via a bundled headless Chromium runtime, available in the `-playwright` image variant. The pipeline is a single image, two subcommands:

```
workspace.dsl
   │
   │  docker run structurizr/structurizr:<pin>-playwright
   │      validate -workspace c4/workspace.dsl
   │
   │  docker run structurizr/structurizr:<pin>-playwright
   │      export -workspace c4/workspace.dsl
   │             -format svg
   │             -output c4/views/
   ▼
c4/views/*.svg         ← committed; embedded in arc42 markdown
```

A **`validate`** step runs before `export` on every invocation. If the DSL fails validation, render does not run and the script exits non-zero with a clear error.

**First-run note:** the `-playwright` image downloads Chromium inside the container on first use (3+ minutes). Subsequent renders are fast. The base `structurizr/structurizr:<pin>` (no `-playwright` suffix) lacks Chromium and cannot export SVG — `render.sh` and `verify` mode require the Playwright variant.

The old EOL Docker images (`structurizr/cli`, `structurizr/lite`) and the old two-stage pipeline (`structurizr-cli` → C4-PlantUML → `plantuml/plantuml` → SVG) are not used — the consolidated tool replaces them ([docs/export/png-and-svg](https://docs.structurizr.com/export/png-and-svg)).

## Modes

### Mode 1 — `init` (default)

Scaffold the `docs/architecture/c4/` tree from `templates/`. Substitute the project name + description into `workspace.dsl`. Pin Docker image versions in `render.sh`. Make `render.sh` executable.

**Steps:**
1. Verify `docs/architecture/` exists (create if missing).
2. If `docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl` already exists, **abort** and recommend `verify` or `upgrade` instead. Never overwrite an existing DSL.
3. Resolve project name: from `docs/VISION.md` if present (read `title:` frontmatter), else from the current git remote origin name, else prompt.
4. Copy `templates/workspace.dsl` → `docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl` with `{{project_name}}` and `{{project_description}}` substituted.
5. Copy `templates/render.sh` → `docs/architecture/c4/render.sh` with `{{structurizr_version}}` substituted from the pin table in `references/docker-pipeline.md`. `chmod +x` it.
6. Copy `templates/c4-readme.md` → `docs/architecture/c4/README.md` with the same substitution.
7. Create `docs/architecture/c4/views/.gitkeep`.
8. Run Mode 2 (`verify`) automatically to confirm the scaffold works.
9. Warn the user that the first render will pull the `-playwright` image (~1.8 GB) and download Chromium inside the container (3+ minutes one-time cost).
10. Print a closing report (see §Closing report).

### Mode 2 — `verify`

Confirm the scaffold + Docker image + DSL all work. Read-only — never edits files.

**Steps:**
1. Check that `docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl`, `render.sh`, `README.md`, `views/` all exist.
2. Check that `render.sh` is executable.
3. Check that `render.sh` pins the **`-playwright`** variant (not the base tag, not `:latest`). Flag deviation.
4. Check Docker availability: `docker version` returns 0.
5. Check that the pinned `structurizr/structurizr:<pin>-playwright` image is pullable: `docker image inspect structurizr/structurizr:<pin>-playwright 2>/dev/null || docker pull structurizr/structurizr:<pin>-playwright`.
6. Run `docker run --rm -v $PWD:/work structurizr/structurizr:<pin>-playwright validate -workspace /work/docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl`. If it fails, surface the validation error.
7. Optionally, run `./docs/architecture/c4/render.sh --dry-run`.
8. Report pass/fail per check.

### Mode 3 — `upgrade`

Bump the pinned Docker image version in `render.sh`, re-render all existing views to detect any breaking changes from the renderer.

**Steps:**
1. Read the current pin from `docs/architecture/c4/render.sh`.
2. Show the recommended new pin from `references/docker-pipeline.md` (kit-maintained pin table).
3. Ask the user to confirm the bump.
4. Edit `render.sh` to update the pin (preserve the `-playwright` suffix).
5. Run Mode 2 (`verify`) with the new pin.
6. Run `./render.sh` to re-render all views; report any view that produced different SVG output (`git diff --stat docs/architecture/c4/views/`).
7. Recommend committing the render-script bump + any re-rendered SVGs together so reviewers can correlate.

## Cross-references

- `arch-c4` (companion skill) — edits `workspace.dsl`, runs `render.sh`, embeds SVGs into arc42 markdown. Always check that `arch-structurizr init` has run first.
- `arch-adr` — infra ADRs (Docker base image policy, render-tool choice) may reference this skill's pin table.
- `rules/metamodel.md` — supporting-skills list entry + canonical paths for `docs/architecture/c4/`.

## Optional — Structurizr MCP server

The official `structurizr/mcp` Docker image exposes DSL validate / parse / export operations as MCP tools an agent can call directly (no shell-out). Setting it up is **optional** — `arch-structurizr` + `arch-c4` work without it via `docker run` shell calls.

See `references/mcp-optional.md` for the trade-off and setup instructions if you want the MCP path.

## Reference materials

- `references/dsl-conventions.md` — Structurizr DSL imperative grammar, brace placement, no-forward-reference rule, kit identifier conventions (`SYS_NN`, `CON_NN`, `CMP_NN`, `DN_NN`), view-key naming.
- `references/docker-pipeline.md` — render.sh contract, pinned versions, volume mount conventions, troubleshooting, CI hook recommendations.
- `references/structurizr-cheatsheet.md` — common DSL constructs (person, softwareSystem, container, component, deploymentEnvironment, relationships, views, styling, !include).
- `references/mcp-optional.md` — Structurizr MCP server setup if you want validate-as-MCP-tool.

## Closing report

After each mode, deliver:

- Mode executed (init / verify / upgrade)
- Files created or modified (list)
- Pinned versions: Structurizr CLI + PlantUML
- DSL validation result
- Next step: `arch-c4 context` (if init) or commit (if upgrade)
