# Example Platform — Delivery Roadmap

Dual-purpose delivery plan + product roadmap.

---

## Walking Skeleton — MVP

**Hypothesis to validate:** A customer can place and receive one order end-to-end without manual support.
**Value stream delivered end-to-end:** VS-2 · Order to Delivery — Pain: Critical

| Epic | MVP functionalities | Deferred to Phase 1 |
|---|---|---|
| E-01 | C1.1.F01 · C1.2.F01 | SSO, RBAC |
| E-02 | C2.1.F01 | Bulk import |

**After MVP ships, P-01 can:**
1. Create an account and log in
2. Place a single validated order
3. Receive delivery confirmation

**After MVP ships, P-01 cannot yet:**
- Import orders in bulk → Phase 1 (E-02 complete)
- Use SSO → Phase 1 (E-01 complete)

## Phase Plan

| Phase | Epics | Value streams fully operational | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MVP** | E-01 (partial), E-02 (partial) | VS-2 (thin slice) | P-01 completes one order end-to-end. |
| **Phase 1** | E-01, E-02 complete | VS-1 · VS-2 | P-01 onboards and orders without workarounds. |
| **Phase 2** | E-03 | VS-3 | Operators bill and observe the platform. |
