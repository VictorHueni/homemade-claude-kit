# 6. Runtime View

> "The runtime view describes the concrete behavior and interactions of the system's building blocks in form of scenarios." — arc42 §6

Each scenario below shows how the system's building blocks collaborate to fulfil a specific use case. The **prose and the scenario identity (`SCN-NN`) are owned by `arch-arc42`**; the figure is *pulled* from a generator via the declared-dependency comment (see ADR-0004). For the static structure, see [§5 Building Block View](./05-building-blocks.md). For aggregate-internal state machines, see [`docs/domain/07b-models/`](../../domain/07b-models/).

**Figure source — pick per the §6 boundary rule:**

- **C4 dynamic view** (`arch-c4 runtime`, rendered to `../c4/views/`) — for cross-container flows tied to the C4 model.
- **UML sequence** (`arch-uml sequence`, rendered to `../diagrams/views/`) — for intra-component / algorithmic detail richer than the C4 model carries (`alt`/`par`/`loop`).

<!-- One §6.x block per scenario. Authored via `arch-arc42 runtime` mode. -->

## 6.1 {{scenario_title}} (`SCN-01`)

**Motivation:** _TODO_ — one sentence explaining why this scenario is architecturally significant (e.g. "Shows the end-to-end claim submission flow, highlighting the async handoff to the insurer integration service").

**Participants:** _TODO_ — list `CON-NN` containers (and any `P-NN` actors or external `SYS-NN`) involved.

### Step table

| Step | From | To | Message / action | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ |

(One row per annotated step in the Structurizr dynamic view. Numbering must match the DSL `"step"` property values.)

### Error / alternative flows

_TODO_ — describe what happens when step N fails. Skip if error handling is trivial (caller receives HTTP 5xx, retries handled by client). Document when the error path involves a saga rollback, compensating transaction, dead-letter queue, or circuit breaker.
