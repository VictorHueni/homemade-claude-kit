# C4 model authoring → arc42 §3 / §5 / §7 generated tables

Single skill, five modes. The Structurizr DSL workspace (`docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl`) is the single source of truth; this skill edits it, renders SVGs via `render.sh`, and writes **only the generated block** (the diagram embed + the DSL-derived table) into the arc42 markdown — fenced by `<!-- arch-c4:start key=… -->` / `<!-- arch-c4:end key=… -->` markers.

**Ownership (ADR-0004 — ownership by content type):** `arch-c4` owns *derived* content (the C4 diagram + the table that is a projection of `workspace.dsl`). It authors **no arc42 narrative** — all prose, every section, plus the runtime scenario identity (`SCN-NN`), is owned by `arch-arc42`. The two skills co-write the §3/§5/§7 files: `arch-c4` only ever rewrites *between* its markers; everything outside them belongs to `arch-arc42`.

> "The C4 model is a hierarchical way to think about the static structures of a software system in terms of containers, components, and code." — Simon Brown, [c4model.com](https://c4model.com)

**Prerequisite:** `arch-structurizr init` must have run. If `docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl` doesn't exist, this skill aborts and points the user there.

---

## What this skill is NOT

- **Not a substitute for `domain-model`.** The Building Block View is technical decomposition (containers, components, modules — Spring Boot apps, Postgres databases, Kafka topics). It is **not** a re-statement of the domain model. See `references/boundary-discipline.md` for the three tests that keep them separate.
- **Not a substitute for `domain-model` state machines.** Runtime scenarios show how containers exchange messages to fulfil a use case. They are NOT per-aggregate lifecycle diagrams (those live in `docs/domain/07b-models/`). See `references/boundary-discipline.md` for the dynamic/behavioral boundary.
- **Not a one-off renderer.** Every edit goes through `workspace.dsl` so the model stays consistent across views. Direct SVG hand-editing is forbidden — `arch-structurizr verify` will flag drift.
- **Not an arc42 narrative author.** Per ADR-0004, `arch-c4` writes only the *generated block* (diagram + DSL-derived table) inside its `arch-c4:start/end` markers. It never writes motivation paragraphs, cross-section prose, or §6 runtime narrative — that is `arch-arc42`. If the user asks for "the building-block prose," route the narrative to `arch-arc42` and keep your output inside the markers.

---

## The modes

Each *generated-table* mode (`context`, `container`, `component`, `deployment`) (a) edits `workspace.dsl`, (b) runs `render.sh` to produce SVGs, (c) writes **only the generated block** (diagram embed + table) into the arc42 file, between `<!-- arch-c4:start key=… -->` / `<!-- arch-c4:end key=… -->` markers. The `runtime` mode produces **only the dynamic-view SVG** (no §6 prose — `arch-arc42` owns §6 and the `SCN-NN` identity, and embeds the SVG via a declared-dependency block).

| Mode | arc42 § | C4 level | DSL view type | View key pattern | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `context` | §3 | Level 1 — System Context | `systemContext` | `systemContext` | generated block in `arc42/03-context.md` (keys `systemContext`, `systemContext-technical`) |
| `container` | §5.1 | Level 2 — Container | `container` | `containers` | generated block in `arc42/05-building-blocks.md` (key `containers`) |
| `component` | §5.2 / §5.3 | Level 3 — Component | `component` | `components-<CON-NN>` | generated block per drilled container in `arc42/05-building-blocks.md` (key `components-<CON-NN>`) |
| `deployment` | §7 | Deployment | `deployment` | `deployment-<env-slug>` | generated block per environment in `arc42/07-deployment.md` (key `deployment-<env-slug>`) |
| `runtime` | §6 *(figure only)* | Dynamic (runtime) | `dynamic` | `runtime-<SCN-NN>-<slug>` | **SVG only** — no markdown; `arch-arc42 runtime` owns §6 prose + `SCN-NN` and embeds the SVG |

---

## Mode 1 — `context` (arc42 §3, C4 Level 1)

System context: the system being documented + all communication partners (people + external systems). Black-box treatment — internals not shown.

### Pre-flight

1. `docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl` exists (else point to `arch-structurizr`).
2. Read `docs/business/01a-personas.md` if present — every Tier-1 persona is a candidate actor. Carry forward `P-NN` IDs.
3. Read `docs/domain/02b-bounded-contexts.md` if present — external systems may correspond to integrations with neighbouring BCs marked `Generic` (commodity, often external SaaS).
4. Read `docs/architecture/interfaces/*.md` if present — externally-facing service contracts indicate which neighbouring systems consume the API.

### Step 0 — Context questions (ask verbatim; user responds with letter codes, e.g. "1A, 2B")

```
1. What is the primary software system this context view documents?
   A. [name a specific system — e.g. "Claims Platform"]
   B. There are multiple in scope — list them and I'll pick one
   C. Re-read VISION.md and propose

2. Source for actor identification?
   A. Personas (business-persona) — all Tier-1 personas become P-NN actors
   B. Process docs (business-process) — extract actors from §Actors
   C. Discovery — describe the actors interactively

3. Source for external systems?
   A. Bounded contexts marked Generic in the BC map
   B. Service contracts (arch-service-contract) — external dependencies listed there
   C. Discovery — describe the external systems interactively
   D. None — the system is standalone

4. Diagram orientation preference?
   A. lr (left-to-right — default for context diagrams)
   B. tb (top-to-bottom — works for 8+ actors)
```

### Fill process

1. Assign the next `SYS-NN` ID to the primary system (or reuse if it exists in the DSL).
2. For each actor: assign `P-NN` (reuse from personas if matched) and add a `person` element with `tags "internal"` or `"external"`.
3. For each external system: assign `SYS-NN` and add a `softwareSystem` with `tags "external"`.
4. Add relationships: typically actor → primary system, primary system ↔ external system. One direction per relationship (Structurizr renders bidirectional as two arrows).
5. Add or update the `systemContext SYS_NN "systemContext"` view block.
6. Run `./docs/architecture/c4/render.sh systemContext` — confirm `views/systemContext.svg` is produced.
7. Write the **generated blocks** into `docs/architecture/arc42/03-context.md`: between `<!-- arch-c4:start key=systemContext -->`/`end` put the SVG embed + the §3.1 partners table (one row per communication partner); between `<!-- arch-c4:start key=systemContext-technical -->`/`end` put the §3.2 Technical Context table (channels + protocols). Rewrite **only** inside the markers — leave all surrounding narrative untouched (it is `arch-arc42`'s). If the file doesn't exist yet, create it from `templates/arc42-03-context.md` (shared with `arch-arc42`) and fill the marked blocks only.
8. Run discipline checks (see `references/c4-model.md` §Quality checks).

---

## Mode 2 — `container` (arc42 §5.1, C4 Level 2)

Zoom inside the primary system: show its containers (deployable runtime units — apps, services, databases, message brokers) and their relationships.

### Pre-flight

1. `arch-structurizr init` has run; `workspace.dsl` exists.
2. Context view exists (`SYS-NN` is in the DSL).
3. Read `docs/domain/02b-bounded-contexts.md` — each BC is a candidate cluster of containers. Microservices typically map 1 BC → 1+ containers; modular monoliths map N BCs → 1 container.
4. Read `docs/product-specs/07a-fbs.md` — `C-N.M.FXX` functionalities hint at which containers exist.

### Step 0 — Context questions

```
1. Container topology?
   A. Microservices — one service per BC
   B. Modular monolith — single deployable, modules per BC
   C. Layered monolith — frontend + backend + DB (BC boundaries are logical, not physical)
   D. Hybrid — I'll describe

2. Database strategy?
   A. One database per service (microservices default)
   B. Shared database (monolith default)
   C. CQRS — separate write + read stores

3. Asynchronous messaging?
   A. Yes, event bus (Kafka / NATS / RabbitMQ / SQS) — add as a queue container
   B. No, synchronous only
   C. Mixed — sync APIs + selected events
```

### Fill process

1. For each container: assign `CON-NN`, choose appropriate tag (`web`, `mobile`, `database`, `queue`, none for plain services), assign technology label (e.g. `"Node.js 20 + Fastify"`, `"PostgreSQL 16"`, `"Kafka 3.7"`).
2. Add containers as nested elements inside `SYS_NN { ... }`.
3. Add inter-container relationships with technology labels (`"HTTPS/JSON"`, `"SQL/TCP"`, `"Kafka protocol"`, etc.).
4. Add or update the `container SYS_NN "containers"` view block.
5. Run `./render.sh containers`.
6. Write the **generated block** in `docs/architecture/arc42/05-building-blocks.md` between `<!-- arch-c4:start key=containers -->`/`end` — embed `containers.svg`; fill the containers table including the **`Domain aggregates implemented`** column. If a container implements no aggregate (e.g. an event bus), leave the cell empty. The column is mandatory — see `references/boundary-discipline.md`. Rewrite only inside the markers; the §5.1 Motivation paragraph and §Important Interfaces prose are `arch-arc42`'s. Create the file from `templates/arc42-05-building-blocks.md` if absent.

---

## Mode 3 — `component` (arc42 §5.2 / §5.3, C4 Level 3)

Drill into **one container** at a time. Each invocation produces a §5.2.x subsection. Stop drilling when the component-level diagram stops being useful (per arc42: "prefer relevance over completeness — leave out normal, simple, boring or standardised parts").

### Pre-flight

1. Container `CON-NN` to drill is supplied.
2. `domain-model` for the BC implementing this container exists at `docs/domain/07b-models/{bc-slug}.md` — components carry `properties.implements` pointing at `BC-NN.AGG-NN` IDs. Abort if missing; recommend running `domain-model` first.

### Step 0 — Context questions

```
1. Which container should I drill into?
   A. [name CON-NN, e.g. "CON-02 Claims API"]
   B. List the containers and let me pick

2. Component discovery basis?
   A. Domain aggregates (BC-NN.AGG-NN) — one component per aggregate's command-handler + query-handler + repository (recommended for Hexagonal / Clean / DDD)
   B. Tech-layer (controller / service / repository) — classic 3-layer split
   C. Existing code — reverse-engineer from src/ structure

3. Component granularity?
   A. Aggregate-level (5–12 components per container — recommended)
   B. Per-endpoint (one component per route — only for small/simple APIs)
   C. Functional cohesion — group by feature
```

### Fill process

1. For each component inside `CON_NN { ... }`: assign `CMP-NN`, give it a technology label, set `properties.implements` to the `BC-NN.AGG-NN` (or several, comma-separated) the component implements.
2. Add intra-container component relationships.
3. Add a `component CON_NN "components-CON-<NN>"` view block.
4. Run `./render.sh components-CON-<NN>`.
5. Append a §5.2.x **generated block** to `docs/architecture/arc42/05-building-blocks.md` between `<!-- arch-c4:start key=components-CON-<NN> -->`/`end` — embed `components-CON-<NN>.svg`; fill the components table including `Domain aggregates implemented` (extracted from `properties.implements`) and optional `Code path` (extracted from `properties.code-path` if set). Any "why this container was drilled" narrative around the block is `arch-arc42`'s.

---

## Mode 4 — `deployment` (arc42 §7)

Map containers onto infrastructure for one or more environments (dev / staging / production). One deployment view per environment.

### Pre-flight

1. Container view exists (at least one `CON-NN` defined).
2. Read `docs/architecture/decisions/*.md` — infrastructure ADRs (hosting choice, runtime platform, database provisioning, region/zone strategy) are prerequisites. Warn loudly if none exist; let the user proceed only if they confirm.

### Step 0 — Context questions

```
1. Environments to document?
   A. Production only (recommended starting point)
   B. Production + Staging
   C. Production + Staging + Development
   D. Custom list

2. Cloud / infra style?
   A. Single-cloud Kubernetes (e.g. EKS / GKE / AKS)
   B. Serverless (e.g. AWS Lambda + RDS + SQS)
   C. PaaS (e.g. Fly.io / Render / Heroku)
   D. Self-hosted VMs / on-prem
   E. Hybrid — I'll describe

3. Region / zone strategy?
   A. Single region, single AZ
   B. Single region, multi-AZ
   C. Multi-region active-passive
   D. Multi-region active-active
```

### Fill process

1. For each environment: add a `deploymentEnvironment "<Name>" { ... }` block.
2. Inside, build a tree of `deploymentNode` elements (region → AZ → cluster → namespace → pod, or region → service → instance — whatever matches the infra style). Assign `DN-NN` to nodes worth surfacing in the arc42 markdown.
3. Use `containerInstance CON_NN` to place container instances inside their deployment nodes. Reuse the container DSL identifier.
4. Add a `deployment SYS_NN "<Environment>" "deployment-<env-slug>"` view block per environment.
5. Run `./render.sh deployment-<env-slug>`.
6. Write the per-environment **generated block** in `docs/architecture/arc42/07-deployment.md` between `<!-- arch-c4:start key=deployment-<env-slug> -->`/`end` — embed `deployment-<env-slug>.svg` + the building-block→infrastructure mapping table. The Motivation and Quality/Performance narrative sit OUTSIDE the markers and are `arch-arc42`'s. Create the file from `templates/arc42-07-deployment.md` if absent.

---

## Mode 5 — `runtime` (arc42 §6 — **figure producer only**)

Key runtime scenarios showing how containers (and optionally external systems) collaborate over time to fulfil an important use case. Uses Structurizr **dynamic views** — the same DSL elements, but ordered as a sequence with step numbers.

**Ownership (ADR-0004):** `arch-arc42` owns arc42 §6 — the prose, the step table, and the scenario identity `SCN-NN`. This mode does **not** write `06-runtime-view.md`; it only edits the DSL `dynamic` block and renders the SVG keyed by a `SCN-NN` that `arch-arc42` has minted. `arch-arc42` then embeds the SVG via its §6 declared-dependency block. Use this mode only when the §6 boundary rule selects a **C4 dynamic view** (cross-container flow tied to the C4 model); for intra-component / algorithmic detail `arch-arc42` pulls an `arch-uml sequence` instead.

### Pre-flight

1. Container view exists (`CON-NN` identifiers are in the DSL). Runtime views reference those identifiers — containers must be defined first.
2. Read `docs/business/04-value-streams.md` if present — value stream stages and pain points indicate which scenarios matter most.
3. Read `docs/domain/07b-models/{bc-slug}.md` if present — commands and events in the domain model map to messages in the runtime scenario.

### Step 0 — Context questions

```
1. Which use case / user story does this scenario illustrate?
   A. Happy path for a core capability (recommended first scenario)
   B. Error / fallback path for an existing happy-path scenario
   C. A cross-cutting concern (auth, audit, notification) that touches many containers
   D. Describe — I'll name the scenario

2. Level of detail?
   A. Container-to-container (Level 2) — recommended default
   B. Component-to-component (Level 3) — only if CON-NN has been drilled via `component` mode

3. Participants?
   A. Auto-detect from the domain model commands/events for the relevant BC
   B. I'll list the participants explicitly
```

### Fill process

1. Use the `SCN-NN` supplied by `arch-arc42` (it owns §6 and mints the scenario identity). If invoked standalone, pause and have `arch-arc42 runtime` mint the `SCN-NN` first, then proceed. Choose a slug (e.g. `scn-01-claim-submission`).
2. Inside the DSL `dynamic` block, list elements and relationships in step order: `<source> -> <target> "<message>" { properties { "step" "1" } }`.
3. Add or update a `dynamic SYS_NN "runtime-<SCN-NN>-<slug>"` view block.
4. Run `./docs/architecture/c4/render.sh runtime-<SCN-NN>-<slug>` — confirm `views/runtime-<SCN-NN>-<slug>.svg` is produced.
5. **Report the rendered SVG path back to `arch-arc42`**, which embeds it in §6.x via its declared-dependency block (`<!-- arch-figure scenario=SCN-NN source=arch-c4 path=… -->`) and authors the step table + error flows. `arch-c4` writes no §6 markdown.

### Boundary rules — runtime vs domain-model

| This view | Domain model (`docs/domain/07b-models/`) |
|---|---|
| Shows HOW containers communicate to deliver a use case | Shows WHAT aggregates do internally (state transitions, invariants) |
| Messages are wire-level (HTTP, Kafka events, gRPC calls) | Messages are domain commands and events |
| Participants are `CON-NN` containers (or `CMP-NN` for Level 3) | Participants are `BC-NN.AGG-NN` aggregates |
| Timeline is the call chain across deployment units | Timeline is the aggregate's own lifecycle |
| **Do NOT** show intra-aggregate state transitions here | **Do NOT** show inter-container call chains there |

---

## DSL editing rules (apply to all five modes)

1. **Forward references are forbidden** — declare every identifier before any relationship that uses it. The `validate` step in `render.sh` catches violations but the skill avoids creating them in the first place.
2. **Identifier convention** — kit IDs (`SYS-NN`, `CON-NN`, `CMP-NN`, `DN-NN`, `P-NN`) use hyphens in display names; DSL identifiers use underscores (`SYS_NN`, `CON_NN`, …). See `arch-structurizr/references/dsl-conventions.md`.
3. **One element per line** — even if the DSL accepts collapsed forms, write one element per line so the kit's audit can grep it.
4. **`properties.implements` is mandatory on every component** — the cross-reference to `domain-model` aggregates. Use `"BC-NN.AGG-NN"` (or a comma-separated list) for domain components; use the sentinel `"none"` for tech-only components (HTTP framework wrappers, generic middleware, observability hooks). Empty string `""` is **not** valid — Structurizr DSL rejects empty property values. Any component missing the `implements` property fails the boundary discipline check.
5. **Tag policy** — apply kit-standard tags only (see `arch-structurizr/references/structurizr-cheatsheet.md` §Tag conventions). Don't invent new tags without updating the styling block.

---

## Closing report (every mode)

- Mode executed (context / container / component / deployment / runtime)
- DSL edits made (number of elements added; new IDs assigned with their kit ID)
- Views rendered (list of `<view-key>.svg` files produced)
- Generated block(s) written (file + marker key) — or, for `runtime`, the SVG path handed to `arch-arc42` (no markdown written)
- Boundary checks: each component's `implements` field validated against `domain-model`; flag any orphan
- Confirm: no prose written outside `arch-c4:start/end` markers (narrative is `arch-arc42`'s)
- Next step suggestion: typically the next mode in the order context → container → component → deployment; for a runtime scenario, hand off to `arch-arc42 runtime`

## Reference materials

- `references/c4-model.md` — Simon Brown's C4 abstractions; Level 1/2/3/4; when to stop drilling; quality checks
- `references/arc42-mapping.md` — exact mapping table from C4 levels to arc42 sections; what each arc42 section requires that C4 doesn't natively cover (e.g. arc42 §3.2 Technical Context — channels + protocols, which C4 doesn't model directly)
- `references/arc42-section-03.md` — arc42 §3 specification (embedded from arc42 v9.0 template; required reading before `context` mode)
- `references/arc42-section-05.md` — arc42 §5 specification (embedded); §5.1 / §5.2 / §5.3 structure rules
- `references/arc42-section-07.md` — arc42 §7 specification (embedded)
  (arc42 §6 spec moved to `arch-arc42/references/arc42-section-06.md` — `arch-arc42` owns §6 prose.)
- `references/dsl-recipes.md` — copy-paste DSL fragments per mode
- `references/view-styling.md` — tag-driven styling cookbook; `-mode dark` rendering note
- `references/boundary-discipline.md` — the three tests separating BBV from `domain-model` and runtime view

## Templates

These skeletons are **shared with `arch-arc42`** (it owns the narrative; `arch-c4` fills the marked generated blocks). `arch-c4` creates the file from the template only if it is absent, then writes inside the `arch-c4:start/end` markers.

- `templates/arc42-03-context.md` — §3 skeleton; generated blocks keyed `systemContext` + `systemContext-technical`
- `templates/arc42-05-building-blocks.md` — §5 skeleton; generated block keyed `containers` (§5.1) + `components-CON-NN` (§5.2.x)
- `templates/arc42-07-deployment.md` — §7 skeleton; generated block keyed `deployment-<env-slug>` per environment

(The §6 runtime template moved to `arch-arc42/templates/arc42-06-runtime-view.md` — `arch-arc42` owns §6; this skill only renders the dynamic-view SVG it embeds.)
