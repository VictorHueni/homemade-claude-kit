# 11. Risks and Technical Debt

> "A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority. Risk management is project management for grown-ups." — arc42 §11 / Tim Lister

Architectural-scope risks and deliberate technical shortcuts that require an architect's attention. Ordered by severity descending. Operational risks (infrastructure failure, DR) belong in ops runbooks.

## 11.1 Active Risks

| ID | Type | Summary | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Contingency | Status | Owner | ADR / QA ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-01 | `architectural` | _TODO_ | medium | high | high | _TODO_ | _TODO_ | open | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

**Type values:** `architectural` · `technical-debt` · `dependency` · `security`  
**Probability / Impact:** `low` · `medium` · `high` · `critical`  
**Severity:** derived — see `references/arc42-section-11.md` for the scoring rule  
**Status:** `open` · `mitigated` · `materialised` · `closed` · `accepted`

### RSK-01 — [Risk title]

**Summary:** _TODO_

**Mitigation:** _TODO_ (what reduces the probability or impact of the risk)

**Contingency:** _TODO_ (what we do if the risk materialises — rollback plan, incident runbook pointer, etc.)

**Acceptance rationale:** _(only if status = `accepted`)_ _TODO_

## 11.2 Technical Debt

Technical debt items are `technical-debt` risks where the shortcut is deliberate and the remediation path is known but not yet scheduled.

| ID | Summary | Affected area | Severity | Remediation path | Due / target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-XX | _TODO_ | _TODO_ | medium | _TODO_ | _TBD_ | open |

---

## 11.3 Closed / Accepted Risks

Risks that have been resolved (status = `closed`) or deliberately accepted (status = `accepted`) are moved here after one review cycle.

_None yet._
