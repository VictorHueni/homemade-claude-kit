# Implementation Planner

This skill guides you through creating a high-quality, structured implementation plan based on the project's standard for atomic increments and test-gated milestones.

## Workflow

1. **Deconstruct Requirement:** Read the PRD or feature request. Identify the core architectural components and the order of operations.
2. **Define Summary:** State the purpose, reference the source PRD, and list the guiding principles (e.g., isolation, small steps, test gates).
3. **Draft Increments:** Break the implementation into small, coherent increments. Each increment MUST be a standalone changeset with a test gate.
4. **Define Delivery Rules:** Include project-wide constraints (e.g., "one increment per commit", "no live API keys").
5. **Group into Milestones:** Create a table grouping increments into logical, standalone delivery chunks.
6. **Save the Plan:** Save the completed plan to `docs/exec-plans/active/{NNNN}_exec_{slug}.md`. The `{NNNN}` MUST match the ID of the corresponding PRD.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `docs/exec-plans/active/`
- **Filename:** `{NNNN}_exec_{slug}.md` (e.g., 0001_exec_onboard-agent.md)
- Open every generated file with the standard artefact frontmatter (title, status, owner, last_reviewed, review_interval). Run `git config user.name` for `owner`. Set `status: draft` on initial scaffold. Default `review_interval: 30d`. Full schema: `rules/artefact-frontmatter.md`.

## Implementation Plan Template

Use the following Markdown structure exactly:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

## Summary

[High-level context and reference to the PRD]

Principles:

1. One increment equals one coherent change set.
2. Every increment has an explicit test gate.
3. [Project-specific principle]

**Overall Status:** pending
**Current Increment:** --

## Increment Plan

### Increment XX: [Descriptive Title]

**Status:** pending

Scope:

1. [Actionable item]
2. [Actionable item]

Primary files:

1. [File path]
2. [File path]

Test gate:

1. [Command to verify success]

Exit criteria:

1. [Outcome 1]
2. [Outcome 2]

[Repeat for each increment...]

## Delivery Rules

1. One increment per commit.
2. Each increment must be independently runnable and reversible.
3. [Other standard rules...]

## Milestone Chunks (Standalone Delivery Groups)

| Milestone      | Increments    | Status  | Coherent Outcome | Standalone Test Gate   | Exit Criteria      | Commit Guidance |
| :------------- | :------------ | :------ | :--------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- | :-------------- |
| [M-ID]: [Name] | [Start]-[End] | pending | [Description]    | [Verification command] | [Success criteria] | [Commit style]  |
```

## Guiding Principles for Planning

- **Atomic Changes:** An increment should be small enough to review easily but large enough to provide value or a foundation.
- **Test-Driven Gates:** Every increment must have a `Test gate`. If no logic is added, use a `smoke test` or `import test`.
- **Deterministic Outcomes:** Exit criteria must be objective and verifiable.
- **Sequential Flow:** Order increments to minimize rework and respect dependencies.
- **Ralph Loop Ready:** Status fields on every increment and milestone enable autonomous execution via the `dev-ralph-loop` skill. Use `**Status:** pending | in-progress | done` to track progress.

## Sync Open Items to the central ledger

Implementation plans frequently carry actionable unresolved work surfaced while
breaking the PRD down into increments — deferred decisions an ADR must close,
doc-gaps to fill before a specific increment can start, follow-up execution
items that should not block the plan but must not be lost, tech-debt items
explicitly deferred. When the plan carries such work, add a document-level
`## Open Items` section per [`rules/open-items-governance.md`](https://github.com/VictorHueni/homemade-claude-kit/blob/main/rules/open-items-governance.md)
§1 + §4 (canonical 11-column schema; rows carry `Source anchor` +
`Source heading` pointing back to the originating increment — e.g.
`#increment-03` + "Increment 03: Normalize Existing Artefact Templates").

After the plan is saved or updated, chain to the `util-open-items` skill to
sync the `## Open Items` rows into the central living ledger at
`project-control/open-items/open-items.md`.

- **Local first, ledger second.** The plan's own `## Open Items` table is
  the authoring surface; the ledger is the consolidated read-out across the
  repo. Always populate the local section first, then invoke sync.
- **Sync preserves provenance.** `util-open-items` carries `Source anchor`
  and `Source heading` forward unchanged so each ledger row navigates back
  into the originating increment, surviving heading edits and anchor renames
  (per `rules/open-items-governance.md` §4 + §5).
- **Sync mints canonical IDs.** Local plan-scoped `OI-NNN` IDs are reassigned
  to ledger-canonical `OI-NNNN` on first sync.
- **Skip when the plan carries no open items.** A plan whose unresolved work
  is fully captured by the increment list itself does not need an
  `## Open Items` section; in that case, sync is skipped. Scaffold `_TODO_`
  placeholders inside an increment scope or test gate are NOT open items and
  MUST NOT be mirrored to the ledger.
- **Re-sync on edits.** When the Ralph Loop or a manual editor closes,
  reassigns, or adds rows, re-invoke sync so the ledger reflects the current
  plan state.

Invoke as: "Sync open items for `docs/exec-plans/active/[NNNN]_exec_[feature-name].md`
via the util-open-items skill in sync mode."
