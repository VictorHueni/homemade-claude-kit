# Metamodel Scaffold

Initialise the canonical `docs/` folder tree, generate a live `docs/INDEX.md` navigation
hub, and wire a stack pointer into `CLAUDE.md`. Run this skill once at the start of every
new project — before any artefact-producing skill is invoked.

The canonical folder tree and artefact paths are defined in `rules/metamodel.md`. This
skill operationalises that definition: it creates the directories, documents them in an
INDEX.md snapshot, and tells the agent where to look. It does NOT create artefact content
— that is the job of the `business-*`, `discovery-*`, `domain-*`, `spec-*`, `arch-*`,
`ops-*`, and `com-*` skills.

**Always the full tree.** Empty folders cost nothing — git ignores them until a file
lands, and `util-metamodel-audit` checks for files, not folders. There is no variant
selection: every project gets the same structure, and only fills what it needs.

**Complement to `util-metamodel-migration`:** migration restructures an existing docs/
folder that predates the metamodel. Scaffold initialises a fresh structure. Run scaffold
on new projects; run migration on existing ones.

---

## The three modes

### Mode 1 — Full scaffold (default)

**When:** starting a new project with no existing `docs/` structure.

**Step 0 — Clarifying questions (ask BEFORE running)**

Ask the user these 2 questions in a single message. Users respond like `1A, 2A`:

```text
1. Docs root?
   A. docs/ (default)
   B. Other — please specify

2. Wire the stack pointer into CLAUDE.md after scaffold?
   A. Yes — update CLAUDE.md (or create it if absent)
   B. No — scaffold only; I will update CLAUDE.md manually
```

Also ask for the **project name** if it is not already clear from context — used in the
INDEX.md header.

**Pre-flight check (run before creating anything):**

```bash
existing=$(find {docs_root} -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
echo "Existing markdown files in {docs_root}: $existing"
```

If `{docs_root}` already contains markdown files, warn the user:

> "`docs/` already has N markdown file(s). Running scaffold will create any missing
> canonical folders and **overwrite `docs/INDEX.md`** with a fresh status snapshot.
> Existing artefact files are NOT touched.
> If the folder structure needs restructuring (files in wrong locations), run
> `util-metamodel-migration` instead. Continue with scaffold? (Y/N)"

If the user says N, stop and suggest `util-metamodel-migration` Mode 1.
If the user says Y, proceed.

**Process:**
1. Read the full folder list from `references/folder-catalogue.md`.
2. For each folder in the list: `mkdir -p {folder}`.
3. Place a `.gitkeep` in every empty leaf folder so the tree is git-trackable.
4. Create the `docs/project-control/open-items/` control plane — see §Project-control scaffold.
5. **`.gitignore` check:**
   ```bash
   grep -q 'var/reports' .gitignore 2>/dev/null \
     || echo "SUGGEST: 'var/reports/' is not in .gitignore — generated reports should not be committed."
   ```
   Record the result; surface it in the closing report.
6. Detect the current status of each canonical artefact path (bash — same logic as
   `util-metamodel-audit` Check 1) and generate `docs/INDEX.md` from
   `references/index-template.md`.
7. If the user chose to wire CLAUDE.md (Step 0 option 2A): apply the stack pointer update
   (see §CLAUDE.md update rules below).

**Output verification:**
- All canonical folders exist (`find {docs_root} -type d | sort`).
- `docs/INDEX.md` exists and contains a row for every canonical artefact step.
- `docs/project-control/open-items/open-items.md` and `docs/project-control/open-items/README.md`
  exist (or were already present and skipped).
- If wired: `CLAUDE.md` contains a reference to `docs/INDEX.md`.
- No artefact content files created — only folders, `.gitkeep` files, `docs/INDEX.md`,
  and the `docs/project-control/open-items/` control-plane stubs.
- If `var/reports/` is absent from `.gitignore`, this was surfaced in the closing report.

---

### Mode 2 — Folders only

**When:** the user wants the directory structure but will manage INDEX.md and CLAUDE.md
separately, or a hub doc already exists.

No Step 0 questions needed beyond docs root.

**Process:**
1. Read folder list from `references/folder-catalogue.md`.
2. `mkdir -p` each folder; place `.gitkeep` in empty leaf folders.
3. Create the `docs/project-control/open-items/` control plane if absent.
4. Report: folders created / folders already existed.

No INDEX.md generated. No CLAUDE.md update.

---

### Mode 3 — INDEX.md refresh

**When:** the project already has a `docs/` structure; the user wants to regenerate
`docs/INDEX.md` with fresh status detection (after completing several stack steps, for
example).

**Process:**
1. Detect docs root (check for existing `docs/INDEX.md` or default to `docs/`).
2. Re-run the status detection bash commands from `references/index-template.md §Detection`.
3. Update the `last_reviewed` field in the frontmatter to today's date before writing.
4. Overwrite `docs/INDEX.md` with the refreshed status snapshot.
5. Report: N steps now ✅ / N steps 🔄 / N steps ⬜.

Does NOT create folders or touch CLAUDE.md.

---

## Folder creation — bash pattern

From `references/folder-catalogue.md`:

```bash
# Create the full canonical tree in one pass
mkdir -p \
  docs/business/05a-processes \
  docs/business/06a-models \
  ...   # (see full list in folder-catalogue.md)

# Place .gitkeep in leaf folders that have no content yet
find docs -mindepth 1 -type d | while read d; do
  if [ -z "$(ls -A "$d" 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    touch "$d/.gitkeep"
  fi
done
```

**Rules:**
- Use `mkdir -p` — safe to run on existing trees; never fails if folder already exists.
- Never delete or overwrite existing files.
- Report how many folders were created vs already existed.

---

## Project-control scaffold

**Scope:** Mode 1 and Mode 2 (always).

Creates the minimal `docs/project-control/open-items/` control plane so `util-open-items`
can run `sync` immediately after the first artefact is authored. Without this structure,
the first sync fails with a missing-path error.

**Files created:**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/project-control/open-items/archive
touch docs/project-control/open-items/archive/.gitkeep
```

Then write two stub files:

**`docs/project-control/open-items/open-items.md`** — empty ledger. Copy the canonical
ledger skeleton from [`util-open-items/references/template.md`](../util-open-items/references/template.md)
§1 verbatim (title, "How rows arrive here", an empty `## Live items` table, "Status
snapshot", "See also"; `_None at present._` initial state).

**`docs/project-control/open-items/README.md`** — operator orientation. Copy the content of
the existing `docs/project-control/open-items/README.md` in the kit as-is — it is
project-agnostic and applies verbatim to any project scaffolded with this skill.

**Safety rules:**
- If `docs/project-control/open-items/open-items.md` already exists: skip creation entirely
  and report "control plane already present".
- Never overwrite an existing ledger.

---

## `.gitignore` check

Run at the end of Mode 1 (step 5). If `var/reports/` is not in `.gitignore`:

1. Surface in the closing report: "⚠️ `var/reports/` is not in `.gitignore`. Generated
   audit and migration reports should not be committed. Add to `.gitignore`:"
   ```
   var/reports/
   ```
2. Do NOT automatically modify `.gitignore` — the user may have a reason for tracking
   reports. Surface it as a suggestion, not an auto-fix.

---

## INDEX.md generation

The INDEX.md is a **point-in-time snapshot** — a navigation hub with live status detected
at the moment the skill runs. It is not a truly dynamic dashboard; run Mode 3 to refresh.

Full template and detection commands in `references/index-template.md`.

**Status detection per step:**

```bash
# ✅ Done        — file/folder found AND < 50% lines are _TODO_
# 🔄 In progress — file/folder found AND ≥ 50% lines are _TODO_
# ⬜ Not started — no file/folder found

check_status() {
  local path="$1"
  if [ -f "$path" ]; then
    total=$(wc -l < "$path")
    todos=$(grep -c '_TODO_' "$path" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    [ "$total" -gt 0 ] && ratio=$(( todos * 100 / total )) || ratio=0
    [ "$ratio" -ge 50 ] && echo "🔄" || echo "✅"
  elif [ -d "$path" ] && [ -n "$(ls "$path"/*.md 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    echo "✅"
  else
    echo "⬜"
  fi
}
```

**INDEX.md frontmatter:** the file lives under `docs/` so it must carry the 5-field
frontmatter schema from `rules/artefact-frontmatter.md`. Use:
- `status: active` — it is always current (it's a generated snapshot, not a draft)
- `review_interval: 30d` — refresh frequently (Mode 3 re-generates it in seconds)

---

## CLAUDE.md update rules

Mirrors the wire-mode pattern from `business-vision`.

1. Check if `CLAUDE.md` exists at the project root.
2. Check if a stack pointer is already present:
   ```bash
   grep -q 'INDEX.md\|metamodel.*scaffold\|documentation stack' CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null \
     && echo "already wired"
   ```
3. **If already wired:** report and skip. Never duplicate.
4. **If `CLAUDE.md` exists but no stack pointer:** append the following block (Edit tool,
   never overwrite):

   ```markdown

   ## Documentation stack (read at session start)

   This project uses the homemade-claude-kit strategic-architecture metamodel.

   - **Index:** [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md) — live artefact status table; run
     `util-metamodel-scaffold` Mode 3 to refresh.
   - **Build order:** `rules/metamodel.md` — 16 steps (Vision → Implementation plans), start at Step 0 (`business-vision`); the `discovery-*` family (idea, research, workshop) is cross-cutting and runs alongside any step.
   - **Audit:** run `util-metamodel-audit` for full health checks
   - **Scaffolded:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

   Before doing any documentation work: read `docs/INDEX.md` to know which steps are
   complete (✅), in progress (🔄), or not started (⬜), and which skill to invoke next.
   ```

5. **If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist:** create it with the block above as the only content,
   wrapped in a minimal header:

   ```markdown
   # Project Context

   ## Documentation stack (read at session start)

   This project uses the homemade-claude-kit strategic-architecture metamodel.

   - **Index:** [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md) — live artefact status table; run
     `util-metamodel-scaffold` Mode 3 to refresh.
   - **Build order:** `rules/metamodel.md` — 16 steps (Vision → Implementation plans), start at Step 0 (`business-vision`); the `discovery-*` family (idea, research, workshop) is cross-cutting and runs alongside any step.
   - **Audit:** run `util-metamodel-audit` for full health checks
   - **Scaffolded:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

   Before doing any documentation work: read `docs/INDEX.md` to know which steps are
   complete (✅), in progress (🔄), or not started (⬜), and which skill to invoke next.
   ```

**Safety rules:**
- NEVER overwrite or truncate an existing `CLAUDE.md`. Append only.
- NEVER duplicate the stack pointer if already present.
- If the existing `CLAUDE.md` already has a "Documentation stack" or "metamodel" section,
  ask the user whether to update it or skip.
- Always show the user exactly what was appended before closing.

## Sizing heuristics

| Element | Value |
|---|---|
| Run cadence | Once per project (Mode 1/2); Mode 3 as needed |
| Time to run Mode 1 | < 10 seconds (mkdir + status detection) |
| INDEX.md refresh cadence | After completing each stack step, or before a sprint review |
| Folders created | ~22 directories (includes the three `docs/discovery/{ideation,interviews,workshops}/` folders) |

---

## Closing report to the user

After any mode, summarise in 5–6 lines:

1. **Mode run** + **docs root**.
2. **Folders created** (N new) / **already existed** (N skipped).
3. **Project-control plane** — created / already present / skipped (Mode 3).
4. **INDEX.md** — written / refreshed / skipped; current status breakdown (✅ N / 🔄 N / ⬜ N).
5. **CLAUDE.md** — updated / created / skipped / already wired.
6. **`.gitignore`** — `var/reports/` present ✅ or missing ⚠️ (suggest the one-liner to add).

**Next step:** always `business-vision` Mode 1 (scaffold) → Mode 2 (fill) → Mode 3 (wire)
unless the user has a specific entry point in mind (e.g. jumping straight to `spec-prd`
for a single-feature engagement, or `business-capability-map` for an existing system).

## Reference materials

- **`references/folder-catalogue.md`** — complete folder list with `mkdir -p` commands.
- **`references/index-template.md`** — INDEX.md skeleton and per-step status detection bash commands.
- **`references/methodology-references.md`** — rationale for the single universal tree, `.gitkeep` discipline, control-plane scope (`docs/project-control/`), and `.gitignore` policy.
