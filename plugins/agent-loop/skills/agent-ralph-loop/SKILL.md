# Ralph Loop Runner

## Overview

The Ralph Loop is an autonomous execution protocol that drives an implementation plan from start to finish. Each iteration implements one increment, validates it against its test gate, commits the change, and advances to the next increment.

The loop follows the principle: **Perceive → Implement → Validate → Commit → Repeat**.

A fresh agent instance handles each iteration, ensuring clean context and preventing drift. The loop terminates when all increments reach `**Status:** done`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the Ralph Loop:

1. **Execution plan exists** in `docs/plans/active/` with `**Status:** pending` on every increment.
2. **Optional PRD exists** in `docs/product-specs/` if you want the loop to track acceptance criteria during execution.
3. **Peer review recommended** — run `agent-peer-review` on the execution plan and PRD if both exist.
4. **Test infrastructure works** — verify the project's test commands run successfully.

## Workspace Setup Protocol

Before the first iteration, prepare the workspace:

1. **Create workspace directory**: `docs/plans/active/NNNN_feature-name/`
2. **Move exec plan into workspace**: Move `docs/plans/active/NNNN_exec_feature-name.md` into the workspace directory. The exec plan's `prd:` frontmatter field (if present) points to the PRD at its canonical location — no copy needed.
3. **Create progress log**: `docs/plans/active/NNNN_feature-name/progress.txt`
4. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b ralph/NNNN-feature-name`

Workspace structure after setup:

```text
docs/plans/active/NNNN_feature-name/
  NNNN_exec_feature-name.md     # Execution plan (prd: frontmatter field links to canonical PRD)
  progress.txt                  # Iteration log
```

## Iteration Protocol

Each iteration follows this exact sequence:

1. **Read workspace**: Load the exec plan and find the next `**Status:** pending` increment.
2. **Set status**: Change that increment's status from `pending` to `in-progress`. Update `**Current Increment:**` in the plan header.
3. **Implement**: Execute the increment's scope items. Follow the primary files list.
4. **Run test gate**: Execute every command listed in the increment's test gate section.
5. **Pottery wheel**: If any test gate fails, fix the issue and re-run. Maximum 3 retries per increment.
6. **Verify exit criteria**: Confirm every statement in the increment's exit criteria section holds. If a criterion is not met, treat it as a test gate failure and re-enter the pottery wheel.
7. **Check the Prediction**: If the increment has a `Prediction:` section, diff the produced output against it. Any changed output path or ledger class it does not name blocks the increment (see Error Recovery). The check is mechanical: an unnamed change is never explained away, however harmless it looks.
8. **Mark done**: Change the increment's status from `in-progress` to `done`.
9. **Update PRD if present**: Check off any acceptance criteria (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) satisfied by this increment. Update each user story's `**Status:**` (`pending` → `in-progress` if some criteria are now checked; `in-progress` → `done` if all criteria for that story are checked). After updating user stories, update the top-level PRD `**Status:**`: set to `in-progress` on the first increment that checks any criterion; set to `complete` when all user story statuses are `done`.
10. **Commit**: Stage and commit with the convention below.
11. **Log progress**: Append an entry to `progress.txt`.
12. **Exit or continue**: If more `pending` increments remain and running interactively, continue to step 1. If running via `ralph.sh`, exit with `RALPH_COMPLETE` signal so the script can spawn a fresh agent.

## Marking Convention

Status values for increments:

- `**Status:** pending` — not yet started
- `**Status:** in-progress` — currently being implemented
- `**Status:** done` — implemented and test gate passed
- `**Status:** blocked` — stopped by a failed pottery wheel or an unpredicted change; `ralph.sh` halts

Status values for milestones (in the Milestone Chunks table):

- `pending` — no increments in this milestone are done
- `in-progress` — at least one increment is done, others remain
- `done` — all increments in this milestone are done

Overall plan status:

- `**Overall Status:** pending` — no work started
- `**Overall Status:** in-progress` — at least one increment done
- `**Overall Status:** done` — all increments done

Optional PRD user story status:

- `**Status:** pending` — not started
- `**Status:** in-progress` — some acceptance criteria checked
- `**Status:** done` — all acceptance criteria checked

## Progress Log Format

Each entry in `progress.txt` follows this format:

```text
## Iteration N
- Increment: XX — [Title]
- Status: done | blocked
- Files changed: [list]
- Test gate: passed | failed (retry M)
- Learnings: [any notable observations]
- Commit: [hash]
- Timestamp: [ISO 8601]
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits with a **meaningful scope** — the capability or product the increment advances, **not** the plan number. The plan ID and increment are preserved in a trailer, so the audit trail is never lost.

```text
<type>(<scope>): <increment title>

Refs: Plan-<NNNN> increment <XX>
```

**Resolving `<scope>` (first match wins):**

1. **Plan-declared scope** — if the plan's Delivery Rules declare a `Commit scope:` (set by `plan-implementation` from the PRD's product/capability), use it verbatim.
2. **Derived from traceability** — else read the plan's PRD §0 Architecture Traceability and use the product (`P-NN` → slug) or capability (`C-N.M` → slug) the plan delivers.
3. **Fallback (no metamodel)** — else use the plan's own feature slug (the `{slug}` in `NNNN_exec_{slug}.md`). **Never fall back to the bare plan number as the scope.**

`<type>` is `feat` / `fix` / `refactor` / etc. per the change. The `Refs:` trailer keeps the plan + increment greppable and survives squash-merge in the commit body.

Examples (scopes are illustrative — use your project's real capability/product names):

- `feat(billing): word-level diff on plan terms` + trailer `Refs: Plan-0042 increment 03`
- `fix(search): correct ranking at the tie-break` + trailer `Refs: Plan-0042 increment 05`
- `refactor(platform): extract shared retry helper` + trailer `Refs: Plan-0042 increment 07`

> **Why:** the scope drives the automated changelog and the stakeholder release note (`com-release-note`). A capability/product scope makes both legible to a non-technical reader and near-mechanical to curate; a bare plan number makes them opaque. This mirrors the canonical [Commit & PR scope vocabulary](../../rules/git-and-tools.md) convention that `dev-git-commit`, `dev-pr`, and `plan-implementation` also follow. Mechanical enforcement is tracked in kit issue #64.

## Completion Detection

The loop is complete when:

1. No increments have `**Status:** pending` or `**Status:** in-progress` in the exec plan.
2. All milestone statuses in the table are `done`.
3. `**Overall Status:**` is set to `done`.

## Archival Protocol

When all increments are done:

1. **Move exec plan**: Move from workspace to `docs/plans/completed/`.
2. **Delete progress log**: Remove `progress.txt`.
3. **Remove workspace**: Delete the empty `NNNN_feature-name/` directory.
4. **Optional**: Invoke `git-dev-pr` to open a pull request for the feature branch.

## Error Recovery

### Blocked increment

If an increment cannot be completed after 3 pottery-wheel retries, or its output changes anything its `Prediction:` does not name:

1. Set its status to `**Status:** blocked`.
2. Log the blocker in `progress.txt` with details.
3. Stop the loop — do not skip increments (they may have dependencies).
4. Notify the user with the blocker details.

### Crash recovery

If the agent or script crashes mid-iteration:

1. Check `git status` and `git log` to determine what was committed.
2. Read `progress.txt` to find the last completed iteration.
3. Find the first `**Status:** pending` or `**Status:** in-progress` increment.
4. If an increment is `in-progress` but not committed, reset it to `pending` and restart.

### Max retries

- Per-increment pottery wheel: 3 attempts maximum.
- Per-loop max iterations: configurable via `ralph.sh --max-iterations` (default: 50).

## Agent Provider and Model Selection

`ralph.sh` defaults to `--agent claude --model sonnet`. Both are overridable per run:

- `--agent <name>` — agent CLI (provider) to use. Currently only `claude` is supported.
- `--model <name>` — model alias (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `fable`) or full model ID (e.g. `claude-sonnet-5`) passed straight through to the `claude` CLI's own `--model` flag for every spawned iteration.

## PRD Modes

`ralph.sh` supports three PRD modes:

- `auto` (default) — if the exec plan's frontmatter contains a `prd:` field pointing to an existing file, the agent reads and updates it; otherwise the loop runs plan-only.
- `--with-prd` — require a `prd:` field in the exec plan frontmatter pointing to an existing file; fail fast if absent or unresolvable.
- `--without-prd` — ignore any `prd:` field and run using only the execution plan and progress log.
