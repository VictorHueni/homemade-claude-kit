# The Metamodel — Strategic Architecture Stack

The **imperative core** of the kit's documentation system: what artefacts the `business-*` /
`domain-*` / `spec-*` / `plan-*` / `arch-*` skills produce, the **order** to build them, and
how the agent drives that work. This skill is the kit's single distribution point for the
metamodel — every doc-producing skill resolves structural facts through it (by skill name:
"the `metamodel` skill's `references/<file>`"; in flat installs it is a sibling directory).

> **Provenance — generated projection (future).** The structural and relational metamodel is
> canonically owned by the **clew** repo (clew ADR-0008): `docs/metamodel/` there is the
> authority; this skill's structural references are the interim hand-authored projection,
> to be emitted by `clew metamodel export` (Phase 4). Do not author new artefact types here
> first — author clew-side, then sync. Per-type *semantics* (what a good persona is,
> methodology, anti-patterns) stay with each minting skill's `## Canonical definition`.

## Reference files (load on demand)

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`references/metamodel-reference.md`](references/metamodel-reference.md) | The heavy companion: supporting-skill catalogue, dependency DAG, ER model, per-step process + output verification, cross-doc ID conventions, canonical path tree, maintenance coupling |
| [`references/artefact-types-registry.yaml`](references/artefact-types-registry.yaml) | Structural registry — one entry per artefact type: `id_format` regex, layout, `default_path`, `review_interval`, `okf_type` display name, slug contract. Parse it (`python3 -c "import yaml; …"`), don't eyeball it |
| [`references/artefact-frontmatter.md`](references/artefact-frontmatter.md) | The OKF-superset frontmatter block every generated `docs/**` artefact opens with |
| [`references/open-items-governance.md`](references/open-items-governance.md) | Cross-cutting open-items contract: central ledger, item taxonomy, provenance fields |

When the user says *"build the documentation stack"*, *"do the strategic docs"*, *"start the
project documentation"*, or *"follow the architecture plan"* — this skill is the authoritative
reference for **what to build, in what order, and where to put it**.

## Modes (lifecycle operations)

Beyond the default **Reference** use (answering stack-level questions, guiding build-order
work), this skill owns three lifecycle modes. Pick by intent; each mode's full procedure is
its file under `references/modes/`:

| Mode | Intent signals | Procedure | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Audit** | "audit my docs stack", "artefact stack health", "metamodel audit", "governance drift" | [`references/modes/audit.md`](references/modes/audit.md) (+ [`audit-check-catalogue.md`](references/modes/audit-check-catalogue.md), [`audit-report-template.md`](references/modes/audit-report-template.md)) | Report-only health check of a project's docs stack — 19 checks derived from the registry: placement, IDs, links, dependencies, frontmatter, open-items governance |
| **Scaffold** | "scaffold the docs folder", "set up the documentation tree", "docs folder setup" | [`references/modes/scaffold.md`](references/modes/scaffold.md) (+ [`scaffold-folder-catalogue.md`](references/modes/scaffold-folder-catalogue.md), [`scaffold-index-template.md`](references/modes/scaffold-index-template.md)) | Creates the canonical `docs/` tree + root `index.md`; the Wire step writes `CLAUDE.md` (the reason this skill carries `impact: medium`) |
| **Migrate** | "migrate my docs", "bring existing docs onto the metamodel", "docs migration report" | [`references/modes/migrate.md`](references/modes/migrate.md) (+ [`migrate-detection-signals.md`](references/modes/migrate-detection-signals.md), [`migrate-path-migration-v2.md`](references/modes/migrate-path-migration-v2.md)) | Report-first migration of an existing docs tree onto the canonical layout — three-tier detection, ≥2-tier agreement before proposing moves |

All three modes parse `references/artefact-types-registry.yaml` at run time for structural
facts — none carries its own copy. Their long-term future is thin wrappers over the clew CLI
(`clew audit` / `clew init` / `clew migrate`), per clew ADR-0008.

> The number is build order, not a strict linear chain — several artefacts are parallelisable
> (see the DAG in [`references/metamodel-reference.md`](references/metamodel-reference.md)).
> Prerequisites, process, and output-verification for each step are in the companion's
> § Recommended build order. Supporting skills not on the spine (`arch-adr`,
> `arch-c4`/`arch-arc42`/`arch-uml`, `discovery-*`, `agent-*`, `ux-design-system`, `com-*`,
> `ops-*`, `util-*`) are catalogued in the companion's § Supporting skills.

**Hub rule:** the Capability Map (`C-N.M`) is the hub — most artefacts soft-link to it by ID.
An arrow `A → B` means *B soft-links to A by ID*; B can be scaffolded before A exists
(placeholder `_TODO_`), filled when A arrives. No cycles. ADRs are not in the linear chain
but must precede Step 9 (Quality Attributes) and Step 10 (PRDs) when their decisions affect
those artefacts.

---

## Variant selection

Pick the variant from user intent, then follow that path in the companion's § Variants:

- **Greenfield (default)** — full spine, Step 0 → 11 in order.
- **Brownfield** (existing system, adding capability) — start at Step 3 (Capability Map); skip Steps 1–2 unless the change touches a new stakeholder or the commercial model.
- **Single feature** (no full architecture) — skip Steps 1–8; go straight to Step 10 (`spec-prd`) with the `E-NN` scope defined inline, then Step 11 (`plan-implementation`).
- **Strategy / investor / exec** — start at Step 2 (BMC); skip Steps 7–11; optionally add Personas (Step 1), a quantitative model (Step 6), or the Capability Map (Step 3).

---

## Cross-doc linking rule

Any artefact that references another uses **ID + name + relative path**, so renames of the
description text don't break the link as long as the ID is stable:

> `[C3.2 prior-authorisation classification](../03a-capability-map.md#c32)`

Artefact-type id_formats are in
[`references/artefact-types-registry.yaml`](references/artefact-types-registry.yaml); diagram
/ arc42 / sub-element IDs (`SYS-NN`, `CON-NN`, `SCN-NN`, …) and the `BC-NN` namespace rule
are in the companion's § Cross-doc ID conventions.

---

## Open Items governance (cross-cutting)

Every artefact can carry unresolved work (research questions, missing decisions, follow-up
items, deferred refactors). The canonical contract for capturing, classifying, and auditing
it is [`references/open-items-governance.md`](references/open-items-governance.md) —
mandatory for any skill whose output may emit unresolved work. In brief: the central ledger
at `docs/project-control/open-items/` is the sole authoring surface (no per-artefact local
section); every row is filed directly and is one of `doc-gap` / `decision-gap` /
`execution-item` / `tech-debt` (inline `_TODO_` placeholders are **not** open items).

---

## How the agent should use this skill

When the user invokes documentation work on a project:

1. **Detect what already exists** — `find docs -type d` to map the current state.
2. **Identify which steps are done vs missing** by checking output paths (canonical tree in the companion's § Canonical output paths).
3. **Pick the variant** (greenfield / brownfield / single-feature / strategy-only) based on user intent.
4. **Execute the next step** using the corresponding skill in its appropriate mode.
5. **Verify the output** before moving on — each step's "Output verification" criteria in the companion.
6. **Maintain cross-doc IDs** — every soft-link uses the ID + name + path format above.

When asked *"build the documentation plan"* without further context, default to:
- Confirm the variant with the user (greenfield is the default).
- Start at Step 1; ask for personas input.
- Proceed sequentially through verification checks.
- One step per session unless the user wants batch execution.

---

## Maintenance

When new skills join the kit or a step / path / ID format changes: **structural facts**
(types, IDs, paths, relationships) are authored in the clew repo first (see Provenance above)
and synced into `references/artefact-types-registry.yaml` and the spine here; the two-stage
blast-radius procedure lives in the kit repo's `util-skill-authoring` skill (`references/metamodel-impact.md`). Failing to keep the
coupled files in sync causes the Audit and Migrate modes to silently miss artefacts — the
most dangerous kind of drift.

**Change history:** the authoritative record is `git log` / `git blame` on this skill and its
coupled files; the *why* of each change is its ADR (kit ADR-0007, clew ADR-0008); the prior
digest is parked at `docs/project-control/metamodel-changelog.md` in the kit repo.
