# Git Enforcement Stack Scaffolder

## Overview

`dev-git-init` provisions the **deterministic git enforcement stack** for a Node, Python, or Maven (JVM) project — the layered set of client-side hooks, server-side checks, and convention files that make every contributor (human or AI) produce compliant commits, branches, and PRs without having to remember the rules. It is the one-shot scaffolder that lands before the project's first real commit.

**Two-layer model the skill assumes** (per industry standard pre-AI tooling):

- **Client-side hooks** = fast, bypassable feedback (husky / pre-commit / commitlint / commitizen / git-build-hook-maven-plugin / gitleaks pre-commit)
- **Server-side checks** = authoritative, unbypassable truth (GitHub Actions + branch protection)

Both layers exist; the AI-skill layer is purely a *compliance helper* on top — it does not replace enforcement.

**Opinionated defaults** (v2.0.0). Most prior choice-points have been replaced by sensible defaults that match the patterns the skill is designed for:

- **Default branch:** assumed `main`. Override only if needed.
- **Commit types:** always the minimal 7 (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`). Teams wanting `style/build/ci/revert` edit `commitlint.config.js` post-scaffold.
- **CI workflows:** always scaffolded. Opt-out is `rm -rf .github/workflows`.
- **`.gitignore` on conflict:** skip-if-exists like every other file. Operator manually merges missing patterns.
- **No `--force` mode:** to overwrite an existing file, `rm` it and re-run.
- **Dependency freshness:** a `.github/dependabot.yml` is always scaffolded (a base slot). It is the freshness mechanism that makes pinning safe — pin actions/dependencies for immutability, Dependabot to keep the pins current. Neither works alone; a stale pin with no watcher is strictly worse than a floating tag.

**Three choices preserved** (genuinely vary across projects):

- **Q1 — Stack + package manager:** pnpm / npm / yarn (Node) · pip-family / uv (Python) · Maven (JVM) (6 options — the package manager pins the exact Dependabot ecosystem; see §Q1 → Dependabot ecosystem)
- **Q2 — Branching strategy + merge mode:** trunk-based + squash / GitLab Flow / GitFlow (3 options)
- **Q3 — Reviewer model:** solo founder admin-bypass / mutual peer / CODEOWNERS-driven (3 options — **no default; operator must make an explicit governance choice**)

**Merge-hygiene layer (conditional — derived from Q2, no extra question).** When Q2 **squash-merges** (option A trunk-based + squash, or option B squash-to-main on release), a squash-merge makes the **PR title** the commit subject that actually lands — and the local `commit-msg` hook never sees it. So the skill additionally scaffolds a **PR-title lint** CI check (reusing the *same* commitlint/commitizen vocabulary — never a second type-list like `amannn/action-semantic-pull-request`), emits the `squash_merge_commit_title = PR_TITLE` repo setting, and — when a capability map / FBS is present — generates a **capability scope-enum** (product/capability slugs + `platform, infra, ci, deps, chore`) wired into both the commit-msg hook and the PR-title lint, with a drift-gate. Full rationale, arming order, and the `cross-cutting` label override live in [`references/scope-enforcement.md`](references/scope-enforcement.md). This layer is inert for GitFlow-only (Q2=C, merge-commits) and degrades to free area/module scopes when there is no capability map.

**Scope discipline:**
- This skill **writes files** — it does NOT install dependencies (`pnpm add ...`, `pip install ...`), execute hooks, or apply remote configuration (branch protection on GitHub). It emits commands for the operator to run.
- It is **uniformly skip-if-exists**: every existing file is preserved untouched. To replace one, delete it and re-run.
- It produces no `.claude/*.yaml` config file. The scaffolded standard files (`commitlint.config.js` / commitizen `pyproject.toml` section / the `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` regex, `.husky/` or `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or `config/git-hooks/` + `pom.xml`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/*`) ARE the source of truth that downstream skills (`dev-git-commit`, `dev-pr`) read.

## Output catalogue

**All files are skip-if-exists.** To overwrite, delete the file and re-run scaffold. No `--force` flag.

| # | Slot | Files (1 slot = these files) | Stack-specific |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `.husky/commit-msg` *(Node only)* | `.husky/commit-msg` | Node — Python uses `.pre-commit-config.yaml` instead |
| 2 | `.husky/pre-commit` *(Node only)* | `.husky/pre-commit` | Node — see above |
| 3 | `.husky/pre-push` *(Node only)* | `.husky/pre-push` | Node — see above |
| 1–3 (Python) | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` *(Python only)* | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Python — replaces the 3 husky slots |
| 1–3 (Maven) | `config/git-hooks/{pre-commit,commit-msg}` *(Maven only)* + `pom.xml` wiring | `config/git-hooks/pre-commit`, `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` | Maven — `git-build-hook-maven-plugin` installs them into `.git/hooks/` on the first `./mvnw` run; no separate pre-push slot |
| 4 | Commit linter config | Node: `commitlint.config.js` · Python: `pyproject.toml` `[tool.commitizen]` section appended · Maven: embedded in `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` (no separate config file — no Node/Python runtime) | All three |
| 5 | `.gitleaks.toml` | `.gitleaks.toml` | All three |
| 6 | `.gitignore` | `.gitignore` | All three (stack-appropriate base) |
| 7 | `.gitattributes` | `.gitattributes` | All three |
| 8 | `.editorconfig` | `.editorconfig` | All three |
| 9 | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | All three (text varies per Q2 + Q3) |
| 10 | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | (file) | All three |
| 11 | `.github/CODEOWNERS` | (file) | All three |
| 12 | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` | `bug.md` + `feature.md` + `docs.md` (3 files) | All three |
| 13 | `.github/workflows/*` | `lint-build.yml` + `typecheck.yml` + `test.yml` + `gitleaks.yml` (4 files) | All three (runtime + commands differ) |
| 14 | `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` | (file) | All three |
| 15 | `.github/dependabot.yml` | (file) | All three (language ecosystem differs per Q1; `docker` / `docker-compose` blocks emitted only when detected) |
| 16 *(conditional — Q2 squash-merge)* | PR-title lint workflow | `.github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml` | All three (Node runs commitlint, Python runs `cz check`, Maven runs the same shell regex as its commit-msg hook) |
| 17 *(conditional — capability map/FBS present)* | Capability scope-enum bundle | `scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py` + `.commit-scopes.json` + `.github/workflows/scope-enum-drift.yml` + the `scope-enum` line wired into the slot-4 commit-linter config | All three (Maven has no native scope-enum either — same advisory-only treatment as Python) |

**17 logical slots — 15 base + 2 conditional.** Node projects fill slots 1–3 with husky; Python fills the same 3 slots with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; Maven fills them with `config/git-hooks/{pre-commit,commit-msg}` wired into `pom.xml` via `git-build-hook-maven-plugin`. Slots 16–17 apply only when their condition holds (see below); everything else is the same across stacks.

**Conditional-slot rules:**
- **Slot 16 (PR-title lint)** is scaffolded only when **Q2 squash-merges** (option A or B). For GitFlow (Q2=C) it is **N/A** — a merge-commit repo lints every branch commit, so the PR title is not the landed subject.
- **Slot 17 (scope-enum bundle)** is scaffolded only when a capability map (`docs/business/03a-capability-map.md`) or FBS (`docs/product-specs/07a-fbs.md`) exists. Absent both, it is **N/A** and scopes fall back to free area/module names (`auth`, `api`, `infra`, `deps`).
- Slot 17's `scope-enum` line only lands if the slot-4 commit-linter config was *also* scaffolded this run (skip-if-exists means a pre-existing config is untouched — the closing report then tells the operator to add the line manually).

**Slot 15 (Dependabot config) is a base slot** — always scaffolded, every repo benefits. It always emits a `github-actions` block (dir `/`, weekly, one grouped PR) plus the language ecosystem from Q1 (`npm` / `pip` / `uv`, dir `/`, monthly, 7-day cooldown, minor+patch grouped); `docker` and/or `docker-compose` blocks are appended **only when a `Dockerfile` / compose file is detected** (never emit empty blocks). `target-branch` is the integration branch derived from Q2. See §`.github/dependabot.yml`, §Q1 → Dependabot ecosystem, and [`references/dependabot-config.md`](references/dependabot-config.md).

What the skill does **NOT** write:
- `lint-staged` config (Node) or per-language lint runners — varies too much within each ecosystem; deferred to follow-up per-stack skills
- A second PR-title type-list Action like `amannn/action-semantic-pull-request` — the PR-title lint (slot 16) reuses the **same** commitlint/commitizen config as the commit-msg hook, so there is one vocabulary and nothing to hand-sync
- ADRs directly — closing report invokes `arch-adr` via the post-scaffold prompt
- `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` script entries — operator adds via the emitted install command (Maven has no analogous scripts section; the `pom.xml` plugin wiring itself is the corresponding config)
- `.claude/*.yaml` config — classical configs above ARE the source of truth

## Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Side effects |
|---|---|---|
| `audit` | Read-only check: which stack components are in place vs missing | None — report only |
| `scaffold` | 3-question Q&A → generate the stack | Writes files; never overwrites existing ones |

---

## Mode: `audit` (read-only)

Run first whenever the project already has any of the stack components.

### Step 1 — detect existing files

```bash
# Run from project root.
# NOTE on slot counting (see §Counting convention below the loop):
#   - .husky/* (Node), .pre-commit-config.yaml (Python), or config/git-hooks/{pre-commit,commit-msg}
#     wired into pom.xml (Maven) = slots 1–3 (one stack populates them)
#   - commitlint.config.{js,mjs} / .commitlintrc.{yaml,json} (Node) OR pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen] (Python) = 1 slot (any one variant)
#   - .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug,feature,docs}.md = 1 slot (3 files)
#   - .github/workflows/{lint-build,typecheck,test,gitleaks}.yml = 1 slot (4 files)
#   - .github/dependabot.yml = slot 15 (base — always)
#   - .github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml = slot 16 (conditional — Q2 squash-merge)
#   - scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py + .commit-scopes.json + scope-enum-drift.yml = slot 17 (conditional — capability map/FBS)
#   Loop checks ~24 paths; audit denominator is 15 base + up to 2 conditional slots.

[ -f docs/business/03a-capability-map.md ] || [ -f docs/product-specs/07a-fbs.md ] \
  && echo "capability map / FBS present → slot 17 applies" \
  || echo "no capability map / FBS → slot 17 N/A (area/module scopes)"

# Also check pyproject.toml for [tool.commitizen] section (Python path)
[ -f pyproject.toml ] && grep -q '^\[tool\.commitizen\]' pyproject.toml \
  && echo "✅ pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen]" \
  || echo "⬜ pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen]"

# Also check pom.xml for the git-build-hook-maven-plugin wiring (Maven path)
[ -f pom.xml ] && grep -q 'git-build-hook-maven-plugin' pom.xml \
  && echo "✅ pom.xml git-build-hook-maven-plugin wired" \
  || echo "⬜ pom.xml git-build-hook-maven-plugin wired"
```

Also detect:
- **Stack:** presence of `package.json` (Node) · `pyproject.toml` (Python) · `pom.xml` + `mvnw` (Maven, JVM). **If none matches, classify as `none / docs-only`** — hook-based pieces cannot run without an app. Recommend either deferring the scaffold or running it after `pnpm init` / `python -m venv && touch pyproject.toml` / scaffolding `pom.xml` + the Maven Wrapper.
- **Package manager (Node only):** presence of `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json`
- **Default branch:** assumed `main`. Operator may override via Q-skip with `--default-branch <name>` flag. Detection is intentionally not chained — assumption is cheaper, override is one flag.
- **Repo platform:** `git remote get-url origin` (github.com / gitlab.com / bitbucket.org)

**Counting convention for the audit report below:** the denominator is **15 base slots + up to 2 conditional slots (16–17)**, one per row in the §Output catalogue. Each grouped row counts as one slot regardless of how many files it expands to (issue templates = 3 files / 1 slot; workflows = 4 files / 1 slot; commitlint config variants count toward the single commit-linter slot; the scope-enum bundle = 3+ files / 1 slot). Mark a slot as **in place** when at least one file in the family exists. For slots 1–3 the rule is: if `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists (Python), it fills all three; if `config/git-hooks/{pre-commit,commit-msg}` exist and are wired into `pom.xml` (Maven), they fill all three; otherwise check each `.husky/*` file (Node). Slot 15 (`.github/dependabot.yml`) is base — always counted. **Conditional slots** are reported as **N/A** (not counted in the denominator) when their condition does not hold: slot 16 is N/A unless the repo squash-merges; slot 17 is N/A unless a capability map / FBS exists. The invariant is: **in-place + missing + N/A = 17**.

### Step 2 — report

Report format (in-place + missing + N/A must always sum to 17):

```
## Audit — git enforcement stack

**Stack detected:** Node + pnpm (pnpm-lock.yaml present)
**Default branch:** main (assumed; override via --default-branch if wrong)
**Platform:** github.com (<owner>/<repo>)
**Merge mode (from CONTRIBUTING.md / assumed Q2):** squash-merge → slot 16 applies
**Capability map / FBS:** present → slot 17 applies

**In place (6 of 17):**
- ✅ .gitignore
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md
- ✅ .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
- ✅ .github/CODEOWNERS
- ✅ .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug, feature, docs}.md  (1 slot — 3 files)
- ✅ scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh

**Missing (11 of 17):**
- ⬜ .husky/commit-msg
- ⬜ .husky/pre-commit
- ⬜ .husky/pre-push
- ⬜ commitlint.config.*  (1 slot — any variant)
- ⬜ .gitleaks.toml
- ⬜ .gitattributes
- ⬜ .editorconfig
- ⬜ .github/workflows/{lint-build, typecheck, test, gitleaks}.yml  (1 slot — 4 files)
- ⬜ .github/dependabot.yml  (slot 15 — base)
- ⬜ .github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml  (slot 16 — squash-merge repo)
- ⬜ scope-enum bundle: gen-commit-scopes.py + .commit-scopes.json + scope-enum-drift.yml  (slot 17 — 3 files)

**N/A (0 of 17):**  (slots 16–17 both applicable here)

**Next action:** run `scaffold` mode to fill the missing 11 components.
The 6 in-place components will be skipped automatically (manual rm + re-run to overwrite).
```

When a conditional slot does not apply, report it under **N/A** instead of Missing, e.g. for a GitFlow (Q2=C) repo with no capability map:

```
**N/A (2 of 17):**
- ▫️ .github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml  (slot 16 — repo is not squash-merge)
- ▫️ scope-enum bundle  (slot 17 — no capability map / FBS)
```

**Docs-only project variant** — when stack detection returns `none / docs-only`, the **Next action** changes:

```
**Next action:** stack is docs-only — hook-based pieces (husky/pre-commit,
commitlint/commitizen, git-build-hook-maven-plugin) cannot run without an app first.
Three paths:
  (1) Defer scaffold until the app is scaffolded (recommended).
  (2) Run `pnpm init` (or `touch pyproject.toml`) first to seed a minimal app,
      then re-run dev-git-init scaffold.
  (3) For a JVM project, scaffold `pom.xml` + the Maven Wrapper first
      (e.g. `mvn archetype:generate` then `mvn wrapper:wrapper`),
      then re-run dev-git-init scaffold.
The scaffold WILL run on a docs-only repo but the hook layer will be inert until
an app exists and the install command is executed.
```

End audit mode.

---

## Mode: `scaffold` (interactive Q&A)

### Step 0 — ask the question set

Three questions upfront. User responds like `1A, 2A, 3` — and for Q3 you MUST wait for an explicit answer (there is no default).

```
1. Stack + package manager? (pins the exact Dependabot ecosystem — see the map below)
   A. pnpm (Node) — recommended for new Node projects
   B. npm (Node)
   C. yarn (Node)
   D. Python, pip-family (pip / pip-tools / poetry / setuptools — requirements.txt or pyproject.toml resolved by pip)
   E. Python, uv (pyproject.toml + uv.lock)
   F. Maven (JVM) — pom.xml + Maven Wrapper (mvnw)

2. Branching strategy + merge mode?
   A. Trunk-based + squash-merge — recommended for solo + small teams + continuous deploy
   B. GitLab Flow with develop integration branch + squash to main on release cadence
   C. GitFlow (develop + release/* + hotfix/*)

3. Reviewer model? (no default — make an explicit governance choice)
   - Solo founder, admin bypass for self-merge — required-review off; you self-merge via `gh pr merge --admin`
   - Mutual peer review — every PR needs 1 approval from any team member
   - CODEOWNERS-driven — required approval from owners of the changed paths
```

If the operator declines to answer Q3 or asks for a recommendation, **do not pick on their behalf** — re-explain the governance trade-off and re-ask. Q3 is the one decision that has too much downstream consequence (branch protection rules, PR auto-assignment, founder admin-bypass policy) to default.

#### Q1 → Dependabot ecosystem

Q1 captures the package manager precisely so slot 15's language ecosystem is exact. The Node managers all map to Dependabot's single `npm` ecosystem (which covers `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml`); Python splits into the two Dependabot Python ecosystems — `pip` (requirements/pyproject resolved by pip, pip-tools, poetry, setuptools) and `uv` (its own ecosystem, reads `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`):

| Q1 | Package manager | Dependabot `package-ecosystem` |
|---|---|---|
| A | pnpm (Node) | `npm` |
| B | npm (Node) | `npm` |
| C | yarn (Node) | `npm` |
| D | Python, pip-family | `pip` |
| E | Python, uv | `uv` |
| F | Maven (JVM) | `maven` |

**D and E differ ONLY at slot 15.** For every other slot they are the same "Python" path — both use `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (slots 1–3), the `pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen]` linter (slot 4), the Python `.gitignore`, and the Python CI-workflow variants. The pip-vs-uv split exists purely to name the Dependabot ecosystem correctly; wherever a template says "Python" or "Q1 = D/E", treat D and E identically.

**Q2 also drives the merge-hygiene layer — no extra question.** If the answer is **2A or 2B (squash-merge)**, the scaffold list gains slot 16 (`pr-title-lint.yml`) and the closing report emits the `squash_merge_commit_title = PR_TITLE` command; if a capability map / FBS is also detected (Step 1) it gains slot 17 (the scope-enum bundle). If the answer is **2C (GitFlow, merge-commits)**, both are skipped as N/A — read [`references/scope-enforcement.md`](references/scope-enforcement.md) for why.

### Step 1 — detect existing project state

Run the audit detection from §Mode: audit Step 1. Capture the list of files that already exist — those will be silently skipped in Step 3.

Also capture:
- **Owner for CODEOWNERS catch-all:** `gh repo view --json owner -q .owner.login 2>/dev/null || git config user.name`
- **Repo full name:** `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null` or parse from `git remote get-url origin`
- **Whether an ADR for git branching strategy already exists:** `grep -l -i "branching strategy\|merge mode" docs/architecture/decisions/adr-*.md 2>/dev/null` — if it returns a match, the post-scaffold ADR prompt (Step 4) will be skipped and the closing report will note the existing ADR.
- **Capability map / FBS (drives slot 17):** `[ -f docs/business/03a-capability-map.md ] || [ -f docs/product-specs/07a-fbs.md ]` — if either exists, slot 17 (scope-enum bundle) applies; otherwise it is N/A and CONTRIBUTING.md documents area/module scopes.
- **Squash-merge (drives slots 16–17):** derived from Q2 (2A/2B = squash → slots apply; 2C = merge-commit → N/A). No detection needed — the operator's Q2 answer is authoritative.
- **Dockerfile / compose presence (drives slot 15's optional blocks):** `find . -iname 'Dockerfile' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' | head -1` and `find . \( -iname 'docker-compose*.y*ml' -o -iname 'compose.y*ml' \) -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' | head -1`. A Dockerfile hit → append a `docker` block to `dependabot.yml`; a compose hit → append a `docker-compose` block. No hit → omit that block entirely (never emit an empty ecosystem). Direct the block's `directory:` at `/` unless the detected file sits in a subdir, in which case use that subdir.
- **Integration branch (drives slot 15's `target-branch`):** derived from Q2 — the same integration-branch concept `dev-release-init` reads. **2A (trunk-based)** → `main` (default branch == integration branch); **2B (GitLab Flow, develop integration)** or **2C (GitFlow)** → the promotion/integration branch (e.g. `develop`). If a promotion flow is chosen but the integration branch name is unknown, confirm it with the operator rather than inventing one. This value substitutes `{{integration_branch}}` in the template.

### Step 2 — confirm scope

Echo back the scoped plan with the answer summary at the top:

```
## Plan

**Answers:** Q1=A (pnpm), Q2=A (trunk-based + squash), Q3=solo founder + admin bypass

**Will scaffold (9 missing slots):**
- .husky/commit-msg, .husky/pre-commit, .husky/pre-push
- commitlint.config.js
- .gitleaks.toml
- .gitattributes
- .editorconfig
- .github/workflows/{lint-build, typecheck, test, gitleaks}.yml
- .github/dependabot.yml (slot 15 — base; github-actions + npm ecosystem, target-branch: main)

**Will skip (6 already exist — manual rm + re-run to overwrite):**
- .gitignore, CONTRIBUTING.md, .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, .github/CODEOWNERS,
  .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug, feature, docs}.md, scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh

**Also scaffold (conditional):**
- [Q2=A/B squash] .github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml (slot 16)
- [capability map/FBS present] scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py + .commit-scopes.json + .github/workflows/scope-enum-drift.yml + commitlint scope-enum line (slot 17)

**Will emit (not execute):**
- pnpm install command for husky + commitlint + gitleaks
- `./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` instruction (run after first CI workflow)
- [Q2=A/B squash] `gh api ... squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE` + PR-title-lint arming-order note
- Post-scaffold ADR prompt (skipped — `adr-0010-git-branching-strategy-and-merge-mode.md` already exists)

Proceed? (y/n)
```

Wait for confirmation. Stop on `n`.

### Step 3 — write files

For each file in the scoped scaffold list, write the appropriate template from §File templates below, substituting per-answer values.

**Idempotency (uniform — applies to every file):**
- File exists → **skip silently**
- File doesn't exist + parent dir doesn't exist → create dir + file
- File doesn't exist + parent dir exists → create file
- **To overwrite an existing file:** the operator deletes it and re-runs. No `--force` flag exists.

**Slots 1–3 (Maven)** — when Q1 = F: write `config/git-hooks/pre-commit` and `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` from §File templates, then wire `git-build-hook-maven-plugin` into `pom.xml`'s `<build><plugins>` (skip the wiring if `pom.xml` already declares the plugin — checked via the Step 1 grep, same skip-if-exists spirit as every other slot).

**Slot 15 (Dependabot config)** — always (base slot): write `.github/dependabot.yml` from the §`.github/dependabot.yml` template. Substitute `{{lang_ecosystem}}` per the Q1 → Dependabot ecosystem map (`npm` / `pip` / `uv`) and `{{integration_branch}}` per the Q2-derived integration branch. Append the `docker` block only if a Dockerfile was detected, and the `docker-compose` block only if a compose file was detected (Step 1) — never emit an empty ecosystem. Skip-if-exists like every file.

**Slot 16 (PR-title lint)** — when Q2 squash-merges: write `.github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml` (Node, Python, or Maven variant per Q1). Skip entirely for Q2=C.

**Slot 17 (scope-enum bundle)** — when a capability map / FBS was detected in Step 1:
1. Copy the generator into the target repo: `cp ~/.claude/skills/dev-git-init/scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py` (skip-if-exists like every file).
2. Generate the committed enum: `python3 scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py --out .commit-scopes.json`. If it exits 2 (no sources readable after all), abort slot 17 and fall back to area/module scopes.
3. Write `.github/workflows/scope-enum-drift.yml`.
4. Wire the `scope-enum` line into the slot-4 commit-linter config **only if that config was scaffolded this same run** (a pre-existing `commitlint.config.js` is skip-if-exists, so the closing report instead tells the operator to add the line by hand).

Make scripts executable: `chmod +x .husky/* config/git-hooks/* scripts/*.sh scripts/*.py` after writing.

### Step 4 — post-scaffold ADR prompt

After all files are written, ask the operator:

```
Scaffold complete. Want me to record the branching strategy (Q2) + reviewer
model (Q3) decisions as an ADR for revisitability?

This invokes the arch-adr skill to create:
  docs/architecture/decisions/adr-XXXX-git-branching-strategy-and-merge-mode.md

The ADR will document:
  - Q2 = <chosen> as the canonical decision with triggers to revisit
  - Q3 = <chosen> as the reviewer model
  - Cross-references to CONTRIBUTING.md and the branch-protection script

Recommended: yes — makes the decision revisitable rather than silent convention.

(y/n)
```

**Skip this prompt entirely** if Step 1 detected an existing branching-strategy ADR (the existence check from `grep -l ... docs/architecture/decisions/adr-*.md`). In that case the closing report mentions the existing ADR and suggests amending it if the scaffold's Q2/Q3 answers differ from the existing ADR's choices.

On `y`: the closing report's Next-steps section adds an explicit `arch-adr create ...` instruction with the Q2 + Q3 values to seed the ADR.

On `n`: the closing report omits the ADR step.

### Step 5 — closing report

```
## Scaffolded
- ✅ .husky/commit-msg (calls commitlint)
- ✅ .husky/pre-commit (calls gitleaks)
- ✅ .husky/pre-push (placeholder for heavy checks)
- ✅ commitlint.config.js (Conventional Commits + minimal 7-type set)
- ✅ .gitleaks.toml (default + project allowlist scaffold)
- ✅ .gitattributes (LF line endings, binary marking)
- ✅ .editorconfig (2-space indent, UTF-8, LF, trim trailing whitespace)
- ✅ .github/workflows/lint-build.yml
- ✅ .github/workflows/typecheck.yml
- ✅ .github/workflows/test.yml
- ✅ .github/workflows/gitleaks.yml (full-history scan)
- ✅ .github/dependabot.yml (github-actions weekly + <npm|pip|uv> monthly w/ 7-day cooldown; target-branch: <integration-branch>; [+ docker / docker-compose blocks when a Dockerfile / compose file was detected])
[If Q2 squash-merges:]
- ✅ .github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml (required check — same vocabulary as the commit-msg hook)
[If capability map / FBS present:]
- ✅ scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py (scope-enum generator)
- ✅ .commit-scopes.json (<N> scopes derived + fixed buckets)
- ✅ .github/workflows/scope-enum-drift.yml (regen-and-diff gate)
- ✅ commitlint.config.js scope-enum wired (or: manual line noted below)

## Skipped (already present — manual rm + re-run to overwrite)
- .gitignore
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
- .github/CODEOWNERS
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug, feature, docs}.md
- scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh

## Next steps

1. Install dependencies (operator runs — skill does not execute):

   # Node:
   pnpm add -D husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
   pnpm exec husky init
   # Python:
   pip install pre-commit commitizen
   pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-commit
   # Maven: nothing to install — git-build-hook-maven-plugin installs the hooks itself,
   # bound to the `initialize` phase; they land in .git/hooks/ on the first ./mvnw run:
   ./mvnw -q initialize
   # gitleaks (all stacks): install via OS package manager
   brew install gitleaks   # macOS
   scoop install gitleaks  # Windows
   apt install gitleaks    # Debian/Ubuntu

2. Verify hooks fire:

   echo "test commit" > .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG && pnpm exec commitlint --edit  # should reject
   echo "feat: test commit" > .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG && pnpm exec commitlint --edit  # should pass
   # Maven (no separate config file — the hook script itself is the linter):
   git commit --allow-empty -m "test commit"        # should reject (commit-msg hook exits 1)
   git commit --allow-empty -m "feat: test commit"  # should pass

3. Commit the scaffold:

   git add .husky/ commitlint.config.js .gitleaks.toml .editorconfig .gitattributes .github/workflows/ .github/dependabot.yml
   # Maven: git add config/git-hooks/ pom.xml ...
   git commit -m "chore(repo): scaffold git enforcement stack via dev-git-init"

4. Push and open the first PR to trigger CI workflows (so status check names register with GitHub).

4a. Dependabot arming (no command to run — a timing note): GitHub reads
    `.github/dependabot.yml` from the DEFAULT branch only. On a trunk-based repo
    (default branch == integration branch) it arms as soon as this scaffold lands
    on the default branch. On a promotion flow it arms only after the next
    integration→main promotion — NOT on the merge into the integration branch.
    Confirm the config is live under Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot.

5. Apply branch protection (once workflows have run at least once):

   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh

[If Q2 squash-merges — emit, do NOT run:]
5a. Set the squash subject to the linted PR title (sibling of branch protection —
    a remote setting; the operator runs it deliberately):

   gh api -X PATCH repos/<owner>/<repo> \
     -f squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE \
     -f squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY

5b. Arming order for the PR-title lint required check (0137 lesson): the check
    must REPORT on a PR before it can be registered as required. So:
      (1) merge this scaffold,
      (2) open one PR → `PR Title Lint` (and `scope-enum-drift`) run and report,
      (3) add "PR Title Lint" to the required contexts in
          scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh, then re-run it.
    Do not expect step 5 to register a check GitHub has never seen.

[If capability map / FBS present — the scope-enum is live:]
5c. If commitlint.config.js already existed (skip-if-exists), add the scope-enum
    line by hand so the allowlist is enforced:
      'scope-enum': [2, 'always', require('./.commit-scopes.json').scopes],
    Regenerate after any capability-map change:
      python3 scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py --out .commit-scopes.json
    The `cross-cutting` PR label bypasses the scope check for genuine
    multi-capability PRs. See references/scope-enforcement.md.

[If Step 4 = yes:]
6. Record the branching decisions as an ADR:

   Run the arch-adr skill:
     arch-adr create "ADR-XXXX — Git Branching Strategy and Merge Mode"

   Seed with: Q2 = <chosen branching strategy> · Q3 = <chosen reviewer model>.
   Include the triggers to revisit (team > 3 contributors, scheduled release
   cadence, multi-PR launch coordination, etc.) so the deferral of any
   alternative is documented rather than silent.

[If Step 4 was skipped because an ADR already exists:]
6. An existing ADR was detected:
     docs/architecture/decisions/adr-XXXX-...md
   If the Q2/Q3 answers above differ from what that ADR documents, amend the
   ADR (don't create a duplicate). Otherwise, no action needed.
```

End scaffold mode.

## File templates

The templates below are inline for self-contained execution. Substitute placeholders per the Q&A answers.

### `.husky/commit-msg` *(Node only — Q1 = A/B/C)*

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"
```

`chmod +x .husky/commit-msg`.

### `.husky/pre-commit` *(Node only)*

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

if command -v gitleaks >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  gitleaks protect --staged --no-banner --redact
else
  echo "⚠ gitleaks not installed — skipping secret scan. Install via your OS package manager."
fi
```

`chmod +x .husky/pre-commit`.

### `.husky/pre-push` *(Node only)*

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Heavy pre-push checks. Uncomment as the project gains the corresponding scripts.
# pnpm typecheck
# pnpm test
```

`chmod +x .husky/pre-push`.

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml` *(Python only — Q1 = D/E)*

```yaml
# https://pre-commit.com
# Install hooks: pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-commit
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
    rev: v3.20.0
    hooks:
      - id: commitizen
        stages: [commit-msg]

  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    rev: v8.18.4
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
        stages: [pre-commit]
```

### `config/git-hooks/pre-commit` + `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` + `pom.xml` wiring *(Maven only — Q1 = F)*

The Maven-world equivalent of husky's `prepare` script: no Node/Python runtime is available, so the
hook logic is plain POSIX shell, and `git-build-hook-maven-plugin` (bound to the `initialize` phase,
which every `./mvnw` invocation runs through) installs the committed scripts into `.git/hooks/` on the
first build — an owner decision over the alternative (`core.hooksPath`), because it needs no operator
step beyond running `./mvnw` once.

**`config/git-hooks/pre-commit`:**

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Installed into .git/hooks/pre-commit by git-build-hook-maven-plugin (initialize phase).
staged_java=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM -- '*.java')
if [ -n "$staged_java" ]; then
  ./mvnw -q spotless:check || { echo "Spotless check failed — run ./mvnw spotless:apply"; exit 1; }
fi

if command -v gitleaks >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  gitleaks protect --staged --no-banner --redact
else
  echo "⚠ gitleaks not installed — skipping secret scan. Install via your OS package manager."
fi
```

**`config/git-hooks/commit-msg`:**

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Installed into .git/hooks/commit-msg by git-build-hook-maven-plugin (initialize phase).
# No Node/Python runtime — plain POSIX shell regex, mirrors the minimal 7-type set
# (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test, perf) the Node/Python linter configs also use.
commit_msg_file="$1"
first_line=$(head -n1 "$commit_msg_file")

# Subjects git GENERATES rather than you authoring them can never match a
# Conventional Commits pattern. Without this bypass, `git merge` and `git revert`
# become uncommittable in the repo.
case "$first_line" in
  "Merge "*|"Revert "*|"fixup!"*|"squash!"*) exit 0 ;;
esac

pattern='^(feat|fix|docs|chore|refactor|test|perf)(\([a-z0-9.-]+\))?!?: .{1,72}$'
if ! printf '%s' "$first_line" | grep -Eq "$pattern"; then
  echo "❌ Commit message does not follow Conventional Commits:"
  echo "   $first_line"
  echo "   Expected: <type>(<scope>): <subject>  (types: feat fix docs chore refactor test perf)"
  exit 1
fi
```

`chmod +x config/git-hooks/pre-commit config/git-hooks/commit-msg`.

**`pom.xml` wiring** — add to the parent (or only) pom's `<build><plugins>`. Pin the exact version;
verified present on Maven Central at scaffold time:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.rudikershaw.gitbuildhook</groupId>
  <artifactId>git-build-hook-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.6.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <installHooks>
      <pre-commit>config/git-hooks/pre-commit</pre-commit>
      <commit-msg>config/git-hooks/commit-msg</commit-msg>
    </installHooks>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>initialize</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>install</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

Skip the `pom.xml` edit if the plugin is already declared (Step 1's `grep -q 'git-build-hook-maven-plugin' pom.xml` check) — same skip-if-exists spirit as every other slot, applied to an existing-file edit rather than a new file.

### `commitlint.config.js` *(Node — minimal 7-type set, always)*

```js
/** @type {import('@commitlint/types').UserConfig} */
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
  rules: {
    'type-enum': [2, 'always', ['feat', 'fix', 'docs', 'chore', 'refactor', 'test', 'perf']],
    'subject-case': [2, 'always', 'lower-case'],
    'subject-max-length': [2, 'always', 72],
    'body-max-line-length': [2, 'always', 72],
    'header-max-length': [2, 'always', 100],
  },
};
```

### `pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen]` *(Python — minimal 7-type set, always)*

Append (or merge) the following block in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
name = "cz_conventional_commits"
version = "0.1.0"
tag_format = "v$version"
# Restrict to the minimal 7-type set
[tool.commitizen.customize]
example = "feat(scope): short subject"
schema = "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
schema_pattern = "^(feat|fix|docs|chore|refactor|test|perf)(\\(.+\\))?: .{1,72}$"
```

(If `pyproject.toml` already has a `[tool.commitizen]` section, skip per the skip-if-exists rule.)

### `.gitleaks.toml`

```toml
# gitleaks config for this repo.
#
# useDefault pulls in gitleaks' own maintained ruleset; everything below is additive.
#
# Do NOT add a bare [[allowlists]] (or legacy [allowlist]) block whose paths/regexes
# arrays are empty. gitleaks 8.x rejects the WHOLE config with
#   "[[allowlists]] must contain at least one check for: commits, paths, regexes, or stopwords"
# and because the pre-commit hook calls gitleaks unconditionally, that fails EVERY
# commit at config-load time rather than failing on a finding. The error text looks
# nothing like a leak report, so it reads as a broken hook.
[extend]
useDefault = true

# Add allowlists as false positives surface, for example:
#
# [[allowlists]]
# description = "Fixture files containing deliberately fake credentials"
# paths = ['''src/test/resources/.*\.json''']
```

**Verify after writing** (any stack): `gitleaks protect --staged --no-banner --redact` should
exit 0 on a clean tree. A non-zero exit with a `Failed to load config` line is the empty-array
trap above, not a finding.

### `.gitignore`

### `CONTRIBUTING.md`

A narrative document covering: TL;DR · branching strategy per Q2 · branch naming table · Conventional Commits (minimal 7-type set) · **commit + PR-title scope vocabulary** (capability/product slugs from `.commit-scopes.json`, or free area/module names when there is no enum — see the kit's `git` rule (commit and PR-title scope)) · PR workflow · CI gates (lint-build, typecheck, test, gitleaks; **+ PR Title Lint + scope-enum-drift when Q2 squash-merges**) · reviewer's checklist · review model per Q3 · local pre-flight · AI-assisted dev habits · branch protection rules per Q3 · conventions-change process. Length target: ~200 lines. Per-Q substitution:

- **Q2 squash-merge (A/B)** → add a "PR titles are commits" note: the PR title is linted (`PR Title Lint`) and becomes the squash subject (`squash_merge_commit_title = PR_TITLE`); its scope must be in `.commit-scopes.json` (or use the `cross-cutting` label). **Q2=C (GitFlow)** → omit this note; the merge-commit lints branch commits instead.
- **Scope-enum present** → document the allowlist + regen command; **absent** → document that scopes are free area/module names (`auth`, `api`, `infra`, `deps`).

- **Q2 = A** → trunk-based + squash; one long-lived branch (`main`); branch lifetime < 1 day
- **Q2 = B** → trunk-based-ish with `develop` integration; squash to `main` on release cadence
- **Q2 = C** → full GitFlow with `develop`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`; merge-commits to `develop`, squash to `main` on release

- **Q3 = solo + admin bypass** → "Founder reviews all PRs; founder uses `gh pr merge --admin` to self-merge"; branch protection rules section explicitly notes "Do not allow bypassing the above settings" stays UNCHECKED
- **Q3 = mutual peer** → "Every PR needs 1 approval from any team member"; "Do not allow bypassing" UNCHECKED at start (small team), CHECKED once trust established
- **Q3 = CODEOWNERS-driven** → "Required approval from CODEOWNERS of the changed paths"; "Require review from Code Owners" enabled; "Do not allow bypassing" CHECKED

### `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

```markdown
<!--

## What's NOT in this PR

<!--
Anti-scope-creep checkpoint. List anything a reviewer might expect to see here that
you intentionally deferred. If nothing, write "Nothing — fully scoped."
-->

## Pre-flight (tick before requesting review)

- [ ] Ran local pre-flight commands — all green
- [ ] Verified every external API call exists in current vendor docs
- [ ] No secrets, no PII, no `.env` content in the diff
- [ ] Self-reviewed the diff in the GitHub UI before requesting review

## Reviewer attention

<!-- Anything specific to look at? Edge cases? A section you're less sure about? -->

## Test plan

<!-- How did you verify this works? What scenarios did you exercise? -->
```

### `.github/CODEOWNERS`

```
# CODEOWNERS — first-match-wins; later patterns override earlier ones.
# Catch-all routes every PR to the owner.

*    @{{owner}}
```

Substitute `{{owner}}` with the detected GitHub username. For Q3 = CODEOWNERS-driven, prepend a comment noting that path-specific owners should be added as the team grows; the catch-all is the floor, not the ceiling.

      - run: ./mvnw -B -ntp compile
```

Substitute `{{default_branch}}` per detected/assumed value (default `main`).

### `.github/workflows/typecheck.yml`

**Node:** runs `pnpm typecheck` (project-defined; typically `tsc --noEmit`).
**Python:** runs `mypy .` or `pyright`.
**Maven:** compilation IS the type check (`./mvnw -B -ntp compile`, already covered by `lint-build.yml`) — this workflow is typically omitted for a Maven repo.

(Structure mirrors `lint-build.yml` with the relevant runtime setup.)

### `.github/workflows/test.yml`

**Node:** runs `pnpm test`.
**Python:** runs `pytest`.
**Maven:** runs `./mvnw -B -ntp test`.

(Structure mirrors `lint-build.yml`.)

### `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`

```yaml

  push:
    branches: [{{default_branch}}]

# gitleaks-action lists the PR's commits on a pull_request event. contents: read
# alone is NOT enough: the call returns 403 "Resource not accessible by integration",

# one. Neither actionlint nor zizmor catches a too-narrow permissions block.

```

### `.github/dependabot.yml` *(slot 15 — base, always scaffolded)*

The dependency-freshness config. Always emits the `github-actions` block plus the language ecosystem from Q1; the `docker` / `docker-compose` blocks are appended **only when detected** (Step 1) — never emit an empty ecosystem. Substitute `{{lang_ecosystem}}` (`npm` / `pip` / `uv` / `maven`, per §Q1 → Dependabot ecosystem) and `{{integration_branch}}` (per the Q2-derived integration branch). **Q1 = F (Maven) overrides the language-ecosystem block's cadence:** `schedule.interval: weekly` in place of `monthly`, and no `groups: minor-patch` section — matching the cadence a real Maven reactor repo in this kit's own family already runs. Full rationale — arming gotcha, ecosystem map, group/cooldown policy, integration-branch resolution — lives in [`references/dependabot-config.md`](references/dependabot-config.md).

**Base template (always — `github-actions` + language ecosystem):**

```yaml
# Dependabot dependency-freshness config.
#
# WHY: pinned actions and locked dependencies never float, so a scheduled bump
# PR is the only thing that moves them. Dependabot is the freshness mechanism
# that makes pinning safe — pin for immutability, Dependabot to keep the pins
# current. A stale pin with no watcher is strictly worse than a floating tag.
#
# ARMING GOTCHA: GitHub reads this file from the DEFAULT branch only. On a
# promotion flow (feature -> integration branch -> main), the config therefore
# arms on the next integration->main promotion, NOT on the merge into the
# integration branch. On a trunk-based repo (default branch == integration
# branch == main) it arms immediately.
#
# target-branch: Dependabot opens its PRs against the integration branch so
# they get the same CI gate as any other PR. Resolved from the branching model
# (Q2): `main` for trunk-based; the integration branch for a promotion flow.

version: 2
updates:
  # Pinned actions never float, so a scheduled bump is the only way they move —
  # weekly, no cooldown, one grouped PR (all update-types) to keep noise low.
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    target-branch: "{{integration_branch}}"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5

      interval: "weekly"

        patterns:
          - "*"

  # Language dependencies: monthly cadence, 7-day cooldown (a supply-chain
  # detection buffer on fresh releases), minor+patch grouped into one PR;
  # majors intentionally fall OUTSIDE the group and arrive as individual PRs so
  # a breaking bump is reviewed on its own. {{lang_ecosystem}} = npm | pip | uv | maven.
  - package-ecosystem: "{{lang_ecosystem}}"
    directory: "/"
    target-branch: "{{integration_branch}}"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"

    groups:
      minor-patch:
        update-types:
          - "minor"
          - "patch"
```

**Docker block — append ONLY when a `Dockerfile` was detected:**

```yaml
  # Dockerfile base images. The `docker` ecosystem parses Dockerfiles only.
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    target-branch: "{{integration_branch}}"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      docker-all:
        patterns:
          - "*"
```

**Compose block — append ONLY when a `docker-compose*.yml` / `compose.yml` was detected:**

```yaml
  # Compose-pinned images. Compose files have their own `docker-compose`
  # ecosystem — the `docker` ecosystem above does NOT parse them.
  - package-ecosystem: "docker-compose"
    directory: "/"
    target-branch: "{{integration_branch}}"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      compose-all:
        patterns:
          - "*"
```

Set each block's `directory:` to `/` unless the detected file lives in a subdirectory, in which case point it there.

### `.github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml` *(slot 16 — only when Q2 squash-merges)*

Validates the PR title against the **same** Conventional-Commits vocabulary as the local commit-msg hook — because a squash-merge makes the PR title the landed commit subject the hook never sees. The title is passed via `env:` (never inline `${{ }}` in `run:`) for template-injection hardening. `name: PR Title Lint` is the stable branch-protection context — keep it stable.

> Actions are shown with floating tags to match this skill's other workflow templates; if your repo policy requires SHA-pinning, pin each `uses:` to a full commit SHA.

**Node variant** (reuses `commitlint.config.js`, including its `scope-enum`):

```yaml
name: PR Title Lint
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]
    branches: [{{default_branch}}]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  pr-title:
    name: PR Title Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
      - run: npm install --no-save @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
      - name: Validate PR title (commitlint — same config as commit-msg hook)
        env:
          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
        run: printf '%s' "$PR_TITLE" | npx --no -- commitlint
```

**Python variant** (reuses `pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen]`):

```yaml
name: PR Title Lint
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]
    branches: [{{default_branch}}]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  pr-title:
    name: PR Title Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4   # for root pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen]
      - name: Validate PR title (commitizen — same config as commit-msg hook)
        # Pin commitizen to match the .pre-commit-config.yaml commit-msg hook rev.
        env:
          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
        run: pipx run --spec commitizen==3.20.0 cz check --message "$PR_TITLE"
```

**Maven variant** (reuses the same shell regex as `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` — no Node/Python runtime, so only the same `actions/checkout@v4` action the other two variants already use):

```yaml
name: PR Title Lint
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]
    branches: [{{default_branch}}]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  pr-title:
    name: PR Title Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Validate PR title (same regex as commit-msg hook — no Node/Python runtime)
        env:
          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
        run: |
          pattern='^(feat|fix|docs|chore|refactor|test|perf)(\([a-z0-9.-]+\))?!?: .{1,72}$'
          if ! printf '%s' "$PR_TITLE" | grep -Eq "$pattern"; then
            echo "::error::PR title does not follow Conventional Commits: $PR_TITLE"
            exit 1
          fi
```

**Advisory scope-enum step** *(append to the job above — only scaffolded when slot 17 is active)*. Warns (does not fail) when the title's scope is outside `.commit-scopes.json`; bypassed by the `cross-cutting` label. To harden to blocking once the vocabulary settles, swap `::warning::` for `::error::` and add `exit 1`.

```yaml
      - name: Advisory — PR-title scope in capability enum
        if: ${{ hashFiles('.commit-scopes.json') != '' && !contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'cross-cutting') }}
        env:
          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
        run: |
          python3 - <<'PY'
          import json, os, re, sys
          title = os.environ["PR_TITLE"]
          m = re.match(r"^[a-z]+(?:\(([^)]+)\))?!?:", title)
          scope = m.group(1) if m and m.group(1) else None
          allowed = set(json.load(open(".commit-scopes.json"))["scopes"])
          if scope and scope not in allowed:
              print(f"::warning::scope '{scope}' is not in .commit-scopes.json "
                    f"({sorted(allowed)}). Use a capability scope or add the "
                    f"'cross-cutting' label. See references/scope-enforcement.md.")
          PY
```

### `.github/workflows/scope-enum-drift.yml` *(slot 17 — only when a capability map / FBS exists)*

Re-runs the generator and diffs against the committed `.commit-scopes.json` — the same regen-and-diff pattern as an `openapi.bundled.yaml` / `requirements.lock` drift-gate. Fails when the capability map / FBS changed without a regen.

```yaml
name: scope-enum-drift
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [{{default_branch}}]
  push:
    branches: [{{default_branch}}]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  scope-enum-drift:
    name: scope-enum-drift
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Regenerate scope-enum and diff against committed copy
        run: |
          python3 scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py --out .commit-scopes.generated.json
          if ! diff -u .commit-scopes.json .commit-scopes.generated.json; then
            echo "::error::.commit-scopes.json is stale — the capability map / FBS changed."
            echo "Run: python3 scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py --out .commit-scopes.json  and commit."
            exit 1
          fi
```

### `scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py` *(slot 17 generator — bundled with the skill)*

Not inlined here — the canonical script ships at `~/.claude/skills/dev-git-init/scripts/gen-commit-scopes.py`. Step 3 copies it into the target repo's `scripts/`. It reads `docs/business/03a-capability-map.md` + `docs/product-specs/07a-fbs.md` (both optional), derives a slug per product and per L0 capability domain, appends the fixed buckets `platform, infra, ci, deps, chore`, and writes byte-stable JSON. Exit 2 = no sources → degrade to area/module scopes.

### `commitlint.config.js` scope-enum wiring *(slot 17 — Node, added to the slot-4 config)*

When slot 17 is active **and** `commitlint.config.js` is scaffolded this run, add one rule so the allowlist is enforced natively on both the commit-msg hook and the PR-title lint:

```js
    'scope-enum': [2, 'always', require('./.commit-scopes.json').scopes],
```

(Python commitizen and the Maven shell-regex hook both have no native scope-enum; the allowlist for those two is the workflow's advisory step above.)

### `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Idempotent — re-run anytime to re-apply branch protection rules.
# Pre-requisites:
#   - gh CLI installed and authenticated with admin scope on the repo
#   - First PR has run at least once so required status check names exist
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh                       # detects repo + uses main
#   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh owner/repo            # explicit repo
#   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh owner/repo branch     # explicit branch

## Stack-specific install commands (closing report)

| Q1 | Install command |
|---|---|
| pnpm (Node) | `pnpm add -D husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional && pnpm exec husky init` |
| npm (Node) | `npm install -D husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional && npx husky init` |
| yarn (Node) | `yarn add -D husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional && yarn husky init` |
| Python | `pip install pre-commit commitizen && pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-commit` |
| Maven (JVM) | nothing to install — `git-build-hook-maven-plugin` installs the hooks itself on the first `./mvnw` run (`./mvnw -q initialize`) |

gitleaks for all: `brew install gitleaks` (macOS) · `scoop install gitleaks` (Windows) · `apt install gitleaks` (Debian/Ubuntu) · or download a binary release from https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases

## Anti-patterns

1. **Silently overwriting existing files.** Every file is skip-if-exists. To replace one, the operator deletes it and re-runs. No `--force` flag — explicit > magic.
2. **Running installers.** The skill is a scaffolder, not an installer. Emit `pnpm add -D ...` for the operator; do not invoke it.
3. **Applying branch protection from the skill.** Branch protection is a remote side effect with lockout risk. Write the script; do not run it.
4. **Generating `.claude/dev-skills.yaml`.** The classical configs ARE the source of truth. Do not mint a parallel schema.
5. **Hardcoding project-specific scopes** in templates. Templates are domain-agnostic; operators add project-specific content in their CONTRIBUTING.md after scaffolding.
6. **Skipping the audit step on existing projects.** Always detect what's present before scaffolding. The Step 2 scope-confirmation prevents surprises.
7. **Defaulting Q3 (reviewer model).** This is the one decision with too much downstream consequence (branch protection rules, founder admin-bypass policy) to default. If the operator declines to answer, re-explain the trade-off and re-ask. Do not pick on their behalf.
8. **Creating duplicate ADRs.** Step 1 detects an existing branching-strategy ADR via grep; the post-scaffold ADR prompt (Step 4) is skipped if one exists. The closing report notes the existing ADR and suggests amending it instead.
9. **Forgetting `chmod +x` on `.husky/*`, `config/git-hooks/*`, and `scripts/*.sh`.** Hooks won't fire if not executable. Step 3 must explicitly set the executable bit on scripts.
10. **Adding `amannn/action-semantic-pull-request` (a second type-list).** The PR-title lint reuses the *same* commitlint/commitizen config as the commit-msg hook — one vocabulary, no drift. A second Action means two type lists to hand-sync.
11. **Interpolating the PR title inline in `run:`.** `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` inside a `run:` block is a template-injection hole. Always bind it to `env: PR_TITLE:` and reference `"$PR_TITLE"`.
12. **Running the `gh api` squash-title or branch-protection commands.** Both are remote side effects — emit them, never execute (same discipline as branch protection).
13. **Registering the PR-title check as required before it has reported.** GitHub rejects an unseen context. Merge → open one PR so it reports → then add it to branch protection.
14. **Hand-editing `.commit-scopes.json`.** It is generated; the drift-gate will fail. Change capability names in the source doc and regenerate instead.
15. **Hard-blocking scope from day one, or enforcing "meaningful" scope.** Start advisory with the `cross-cutting` override; only "in the allowlist" is mechanically enforceable, and only harden to blocking once work-item numbers stop leaking.

## Checklist

**Scaffold mode:**

- [ ] 3 questions asked; Q3 answered explicitly (no default applied)
- [ ] Step 1 detected stack + default branch + existing files + existing branching-strategy ADR (if any)
- [ ] Step 2 scope summary echoed with answers + scaffold list + skip list; operator confirmed
- [ ] Every written file exists at its target path; existing files skipped silently
- [ ] All `.husky/*`, `config/git-hooks/*`, `.sh`, and `.py` files are executable (`chmod +x` applied)
- [ ] Slot 15 (`.github/dependabot.yml`) scaffolded (base — always); `{{lang_ecosystem}}` set per Q1, `{{integration_branch}}` per Q2; docker/docker-compose blocks appended only when detected
- [ ] Slot 16 (`pr-title-lint.yml`) scaffolded iff Q2 squash-merges; PR title bound via `env:`, not inline
- [ ] Slot 17 (generator + `.commit-scopes.json` + drift-gate + scope-enum wiring) scaffolded iff a capability map / FBS exists; generator exit 2 handled as graceful fallback
- [ ] Step 4 ADR prompt asked (unless skipped per existing-ADR detection)
- [ ] Closing report lists scaffolded vs skipped + emits install command for the chosen Q1 stack + (if Q2 squash) the `squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE` command + arming-order note + conditional ADR step per Step 4 answer

**Audit mode:**

- [ ] Detection loop run; all 15 base + up to 2 conditional slots checked
- [ ] Stack + default branch + repo platform + capability-map/FBS presence detected; docs-only branch handled if no stack
- [ ] Report shows in-place / missing / N/A split summing to 17
- [ ] Next-action recommendation given

## Relations to other skills

- **Consumed by `dev-git-commit`** (post-rewrite): reads `commitlint.config.js` (Node) / `pyproject.toml [tool.commitizen]` (Python) / `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` (Maven) for type/scope rules; `.husky/commit-msg`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, or `config/git-hooks/commit-msg` to know what's about to run; project script files for pre-flight commands; `CONTRIBUTING.md` for narrative fallback
- **Consumed by `dev-pr`** (post-rewrite): reads `commitlint.config.js` / commitizen schema for PR title format; `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for body skeleton; `.github/CODEOWNERS` for reviewer acknowledgement; `docs/architecture/decisions/adr-*.md` glob for auto-linking ADR references
- **Invokes `arch-adr`** via the Step 4 post-scaffold prompt (operator runs separately): records the Q2 + Q3 decisions as an ADR for revisitability
- **Enables `dev-release-init`** (release automation) **and `com-release-note`** (stakeholder narrative): the PR-title lint + `squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE` + capability scope-enum guarantee every squash-merge lands a clean, capability-scoped Conventional Commit — the clean history those skills parse to group and attribute changelog entries. `dev-git-init` owns the commit/PR/merge hygiene contract; the release skills consume it and never touch scopes. Setting up releases next? → `dev-release-init` reads this skill's branching-strategy decision + PR-title-lint layer directly.
- **Implements the kit's `git` rule (commit and PR-title scope)** as mechanical enforcement — that rule is the authoring convention (`dev-git-commit`, `dev-pr`, `plan-implementation`, `agent-ralph-loop` all follow it); this skill's scope-enum + PR-title gate are the backstop.
- **Independent of `dev-git-worktree`, `agent-ralph-loop`, `dev-stack-guide`** — they operate alongside the enforcement stack without depending on its scaffolding state
- **Detected by the `metamodel` skill's Audit mode** indirectly — the optional ADR (if created via Step 4 prompt) is checked for frontmatter validity and ID conventions
