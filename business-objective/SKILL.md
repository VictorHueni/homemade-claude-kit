# Business Objective Builder

You are an expert at producing **business objectives and key results** — the strategic-intent layer that answers the question *"Why are we building this, and how will we know it's working?"* before any product or delivery planning begins.

The artefact produced by this skill is **a markdown document** at `docs/business/04b-objectives.md`. It is NOT a feature list (→ FBS), NOT a delivery plan (→ delivery roadmap), NOT a quality spec (→ quality-attributes) — it is the **strategic-intent layer**: a small set of qualitative objectives and their measurable outcomes, connecting commercial intent (BMC) and value stream pain to delivery decisions.

This skill is **domain-agnostic**. When activated inside a project it picks up the project's own personas, value streams, and BMC blocks and uses them as the grounding for objectives.

## Methodology foundation

| Source | What it anchors |
|---|---|
| Doerr, J. (2018). *Measure What Matters: OKRs and the Science of Focusing Your Entire Organization.* Portfolio/Penguin. | OKR format: Objective (qualitative, inspiring) + 3–5 Key Results (measurable outcomes). The core discipline of outcome-over-output. |
| BABOK v3 §1.3. IIBA (2015). | Vocabulary anchor: "Business Requirements describe the goals, objectives, and outcomes that the enterprise needs to achieve." Consistent with the kit's existing BABOK citations. |
| Adzic, G. (2012). *Impact Mapping: Making a Big Impact with Software Products and Projects.* Provoking Thoughts. | Outcome discipline: Key Results must describe changes in behaviour or business metrics, not features delivered. The WHY → WHO → HOW → WHAT cascade. |
| Kaplan, R.S. & Norton, D.P. (1992). "The Balanced Scorecard — Measures that Drive Performance." *HBR* 70(1), 71–79. | 4-perspective classification (Financial / Customer / Process / Learning) used as a **tag only** — not as the primary structure. Keeps objectives multi-dimensional without BSC overhead. |

**Why OKRs and not SMART goals:** SMART goals are output- and task-oriented, with no hierarchy and no outcome vs output distinction. They are already partially embedded in QA acceptance criteria and PRD goal sections. Adding SMART goals as a standalone strategic artefact would duplicate, not add. OKRs are outcome-oriented, cascade naturally (Objective → Key Results), and are widely understood in product organisations.

**Why not pure BMM (Business Motivation Model):** BMM's 6-level hierarchy (Vision → Mission → Goal → Objective → Strategy → Tactic) is overengineered for product-level work. The kit's BMC already captures Vision/Mission loosely. This skill adds the measurable outcomes layer, not the full BMM stack.

## What a "good objectives doc" means

A objectives document is good when a reader can answer, without ambiguity:

| Question | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| **Why does this initiative exist?** | OBJ-NN title + "Why it matters" paragraph |
| **Whose outcomes does it serve?** | OBJ-NN linked to P-NN persona + BSC perspective |
| **How will we measure success?** | KR-NN.M table: baseline, target, measurement method |
| **Which commercial intent does this serve?** | OBJ-NN "Linked from" field → VP-NN or VS-N.M pain index |
| **Which epics trace to this objective?** | §Objective × Epic traceability matrix |
| **Are these outcomes or feature deliveries?** | Every KR must pass the outcome discipline check |

**Hard scope rules:**
- An objective document captures **WHY** (strategic intent) and **HOW WE KNOW IT'S WORKING** (KRs). It does NOT define features, epics, or how to implement.
- Key Results are **outcomes** (metric changes, behaviour changes, business results) — never outputs (features shipped, story points delivered).
- Each KR must have a **baseline** (current state), a **target** (desired state), and a **measurement method** (how you'll know the target was reached).
- Each OBJ-NN carries a **timeframe** — quarterly or annual. Objectives without timeframes are wishes.
- The document has a **changelog** — objectives evolve as evidence arrives. A static objectives doc is a dead one.

## The four modes of operation

### Mode 1 — Scaffold

**When:** the project has no `docs/business/` folder yet.

**Step 0 — Clarifying questions (ask BEFORE generating)**

Ask the user the following 3 questions in a single message with lettered options. Users respond like `1A, 2B, 3C`:

```text
1. Timeframe?
   A. Annual — one set of objectives for the year
   B. Quarterly — one set per quarter (label with quarter, e.g. "Q3 2026")
   C. Initiative-scoped — objectives for a specific initiative (no time expiry until initiative ends)

2. Existing BA artefacts to ground the objectives?
   A. None yet — all soft-link slots stay _TODO_
   B. Some exist — I will check the project (personas, value streams, BMC)
   C. Full BA stack exists — pre-populate "Linked from" fields from existing IDs

3. How many objectives to scaffold?
   A. 1–2 (focused / MVP phase)
   B. 3–5 (standard — recommended)
   C. Placeholder only — scaffold with one empty block, I will fill
```

If the user gives "Other" or pushes back, ask one follow-up to clarify, then proceed.

**Inputs needed:**

| Needed | What you ask if missing |
|---|---|
| **Scope name** | "What product / business / initiative is this objectives doc for?" — used for `{{product_or_scope}}` |

**Output:** `docs/business/04b-objectives.md` sourced from `references/template.md`. Substitute `{{product_or_scope}}` and `{{period}}` placeholders. Do NOT invent objective content in scaffold mode — placeholders only.

**Do NOT** ship a project-side `methodology-references.md`. The canonical bibliography lives in the skill at `references/methodology-references.md` and is linked from the project doc's header.

### Mode 2 — Fill

**When:** the scaffold exists; the user wants to populate objectives and key results.

**Process:**
1. **Read project context** — If `docs/VISION.md` exists, read it first — every objective should be a measurable annual/quarterly step toward the vision's north star, not a disconnected goal. Then read: BMC (`VP-NN` blocks), personas (`P-NN`), value streams (pain index per `VS-N.M`). Objectives synthesise content from these upstream artefacts.
2. **For each OBJ-NN block:**
   - Write a qualitative, inspiring objective title (NOT a feature description).
   - Assign a BSC perspective tag: Financial / Customer / Process / Learning.
   - Declare the owner role and timeframe.
   - Write the "Why it matters" sentence linking to commercial intent (`VP-NN`) or pain (`VS-N.M` pain index).
3. **For each KR under the objective:**
   - Write the outcome as a metric change (apply the outcome discipline check from `references/objective-discipline.md`).
   - Fill baseline, target, and measurement method.
   - Set confidence: `Assumed` (default), `Tested`, `Validated`.
4. **Apply discipline checks** (see `references/objective-discipline.md` §"Anti-patterns"): every KR must pass the outcome vs output test.

### Mode 3 — Align (traceability matrix)

**When:** the objectives doc and delivery roadmap both exist; the user wants to verify epics trace back to objectives.

**Process:**
1. Read `docs/business/04b-objectives.md` and `docs/product-specs/08a-delivery-roadmap.md`.
2. For each E-NN epic, identify which OBJ-NN it serves (look for explicit references or infer from value statement + VS anchor).
3. Build or update the §Objective × Epic traceability matrix.
4. Flag epics with no OBJ-NN reference as **orphaned delivery** — work being built without a stated strategic objective.
5. Flag OBJ-NN objectives with no E-NN epic as **undelivered intent** — the objective is stated but no delivery is planned for it.
6. Flag KR-NN.M targets that are measurable thresholds and have no corresponding QA-XXNN entry — potential grounding opportunity.

### Mode 4 — Refresh

**When:** new evidence arrives (customer interviews, market data, board decision) and objectives need updating.

**Process:**
1. Identify which OBJ-NN or KR-NN.M needs updating.
2. Update the content.
3. Promote or demote confidence: `Assumed` → `Tested` → `Validated`.
4. Add a changelog entry: date + what changed + evidence source + cascading effects on epics / PRDs.
5. Re-run Align mode to check if the traceability matrix needs updating.

## Outcome vs output discipline

**The single most important quality gate in this skill.** Run this test on every Key Result before accepting it.

**Output (wrong — reject):**
- "Ship the confirmation module" — describes a feature delivery
- "Complete 5 user stories in Q3" — describes story points
- "Launch the mobile app" — describes a release
- "Implement the scheduling algorithm" — describes implementation

**Outcome (correct — accept):**
- "Reduce average schedule generation time from 3 working days to < 5 minutes" — measurable behaviour change
- "Increase confirmation rate from 60% to ≥ 90% within 30 days of module launch" — measurable business metric
- "Reduce coordinator time on conflict resolution from 4h/week to < 30min/week" — measurable user behaviour change
- "Achieve zero double-booking incidents in Q1 after go-live" — measurable quality outcome

**The test:** complete the sentence "We will know we succeeded when...".
- "...we shipped X" → output (wrong). Rewrite: what metric changes when the feature works?
- "...X metric changed from Y to Z" → outcome (correct).

---

## The six anti-patterns this skill guards against

1. **Objectives that are actually features.** "Build a mobile app" is a feature; "Reduce time to first value for new users from 2 weeks to 3 days" is an objective. Objectives must describe a future state, not an output.

2. **Key Results that are outputs.** "Ship module X by Q3" says nothing about whether the module worked. Every KR must be a measurable outcome.

3. **Objectives without owners.** An objective without a named owner role drifts. Someone must be accountable for pursuing each objective.

4. **Objectives without timeframes.** An objective that is "always true" is a mission statement, not an OKR. All objectives must have an explicit timeframe.

5. **Unconnected objectives.** Every OBJ-NN must trace back to a commercial intent (`VP-NN` from BMC) or a pain point (`VS-N.M` with High/Critical pain index). Objectives disconnected from commercial or user context are wishful thinking.

6. **Static objectives doc.** No changelog, no confidence-rating updates, no refresh after evidence arrives = the objectives doc dies. Objectives must evolve as the business learns.

## Soft-links — connecting objectives to the BA stack

| Objectives field | Soft-links to |
|---|---|
| **Vision** (upstream root) | `docs/VISION.md` (singleton) — objectives should be measurable steps toward the vision's north star metric; if VISION.md exists, add a "Linked to vision" note on each OBJ-NN |
| **"Linked from"** (OBJ-NN) | BMC Value Propositions (`VP-NN`) from `docs/business/` and/or VS pain index (`VS-N.M`) from `docs/business/04a-value-streams.md` |
| **Personas** (OBJ-NN "whose outcomes") | Personas (`P-NN`) from `docs/business/01a-personas.md` |
| **KR targets** | May ground QA acceptance criteria (`QA-XXNN`) in `docs/product-specs/09a-quality-attributes.md` |
| **§Objective × Epic matrix** | Epics (`E-NN`) from `docs/product-specs/08a-delivery-roadmap.md` |
| **OBJ-NN** | Referenced in PRD `§0 Architecture Traceability` in `docs/product-specs/` |

---

## Output structure

- Open every generated file with the standard artefact frontmatter (title, status, owner, last_reviewed, review_interval). Run `git config user.name` for `owner`. Set `status: draft` on initial scaffold. Default `review_interval: 60d`. Full schema: `rules/artefact-frontmatter.md`.

The skill produces ONE markdown file per objectives cycle. Full template in `references/template.md`. Structure:

```
<!-- doc-version: 1.0 | created: YYYY-MM-DD | timeframe: {{period}} -->

H1: {{product_or_scope}} — Business Objectives

Intro:
  - Scope + timeframe declaration
  - What objectives are, why separate from FBS/PRD
  - Methodology pointer (kit-link)
  - Companion docs (BMC, value streams, personas, delivery roadmap)

§Confidence legend — Assumed / Tested / Validated

§Objectives (one H2 per OBJ-NN)
  Per OBJ-NN:
    - OBJ-NN — Qualitative title (inspiring, NOT a feature)
    - Perspective: Financial | Customer | Process | Learning
    - Timeframe: {{period}}
    - Owner: {{role}}
    - Why it matters: 1 sentence → VP-NN or VS pain index
    - Linked from: VP-NN · VS-N.M (pain index X/5)
    - Key Results table:
      | ID | Key Result (outcome) | Baseline | Target | Measurement method | Confidence |

§Objective × Epic traceability matrix
  | Epic | Epic name | Objective | Key Results served |
  (populated in Align mode; _TODO_ at scaffold)

§Changelog
  | Date | Change | Evidence source | Cascading effects |
```

## Sizing heuristics

| Element | Recommended | Source |
|---|---|
| Objectives per timeframe | 2–5 | Doerr OKR discipline |
| Key Results per objective | 3–5 | Doerr OKR discipline |
| Active timeframes per doc | 1 current + archived previous | Anti-confusion rule |
| Customer-perspective objectives | ≥ 1 (non-negotiable) | Practitioner |

**If any number exceeds the recommended range:**
- Too many objectives → the team cannot focus; reconsider scope or split by initiative.
- Too many KRs per objective → the objective is too broad; split it.
- No Customer-perspective objective → the doc is internally focused; revisit with personas in hand.

---

## Cross-reference — the architecture-artefact lifecycle

The objectives doc sits at the **strategic-intent layer**, above the delivery stack:

| Layer | Owns | Objectives relationship |
|---|---|---|
| **Personas** | Who | OBJ-NN "whose outcomes" soft-links to `P-NN` |
| **BMC** | Commercial logic | `VP-NN` blocks → inform OBJ-NN "Linked from" |
| **Value Streams** | How value flows | `VS-N.M` pain index → informs OBJ priority ordering |
| **Business Objectives** *(this skill)* | Why — strategic intent | — |
| **FBS** | What product does | Functionalities should serve OBJ-NN (traced via epics) |
| **Delivery Roadmap** | Epics | `E-NN` epics reference `OBJ-NN` in value statement |
| **Quality Attributes** | NFRs | `KR-NN.M` targets can ground `QA-XXNN` acceptance criteria |
| **PRDs** | Feature specs | `§0 Architecture Traceability` references `OBJ-NN` |

---

## Finding the right folder

Default: `docs/business/`.

**Always check first:**
```bash
find docs -type d -iname "*objective*" -o -type d -iname "*okr*" 2>/dev/null
```

If a folder exists at a non-default location, use it. If none exists, default and confirm.

**Never overwrite an existing objectives file.** Switch modes if it exists:
- Scaffold mode → skip (report what's there).
- Fill mode → append/update OBJ-NN blocks; preserve existing.
- Align mode → update §Objective × Epic traceability matrix only.
- Refresh mode → update specified OBJ-NN or KR-NN.M; add changelog entry.

---

## Reference materials

- **`references/template.md`** — canonical objectives document skeleton. Copy to `docs/business/04b-objectives.md` and fill placeholders.
- **`references/methodology-references.md`** — canonical bibliography (Doerr, BABOK, Adzic, Kaplan & Norton). **Lives only in the kit** — never copied to projects. Project docs link here via the 2-line pointer in their header.
- **`references/objective-discipline.md`** — internal Claude guidance: outcome vs output test, anti-pattern detection cues, BSC perspective decision tree, KR sizing rules, traceability alignment checks. Never copied into the project.

## Closing report to the user

After running any mode, summarise in 4–6 lines:

1. **Mode executed** + **files created or updated** with paths.
2. **Objectives scaffolded / filled** with OBJ-NN IDs.
3. **Outcome discipline check** — confirm every KR is an outcome, not an output. Flag any KR that failed.
4. **Confidence distribution** — how many `Assumed` / `Tested` / `Validated`.
5. **Traceability gaps** (Align mode) — orphaned epics (no OBJ-NN) and undelivered objectives (no E-NN).
6. **Cross-link opportunities** — which BA artefacts (personas, BMC, value streams, delivery roadmap) the objectives should soft-link to.
