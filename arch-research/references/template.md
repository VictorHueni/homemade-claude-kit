LIFECYCLE LEGEND
  Draft     — actively populating; ADRs should not cite yet
  Active    — content complete enough for ADR citation; further updates allowed
  Frozen    — feeding ADRs have landed; further edits only via Mode 3 Refresh
             that promotes this file to Superseded + creates a successor
  Superseded — replaced by a newer research file; `Superseded by:` link mandatory

## Q1 — {{restated question}}

### Context

{{1–2 paragraphs: why this question matters, what's at stake, which decision it informs. Keep concrete. Avoid generic statements.}}

### Sources consulted

  ★★★★  Major law-firm or audit-firm guidance · official standard documentation
  ★★★   Industry-association guidance · peer-reviewed compliance journal
  ★★    Consultancy blog · vendor whitepaper · Stack Overflow consensus
  ★     Anecdote · single-source weak signal — flag in §Open

### Finding

{{1–3 paragraphs synthesising the sources into a falsifiable answer to the question. Be honest about uncertainty. State the answer first, then nuance.}}

### Implication for ADRs

- **{{ADR-NNNN}}:** {{how this finding shapes option preference — e.g. "Eliminates Option D (database-per-tenant) as over-engineering given INV nFADP Art. 8 'appropriate measures' standard does not mandate physical isolation"}}
- **{{ADR-MMMM}}:** {{...}}

### Open / TODO

- {{Specific gap that wasn't resolved by current sources}}
- {{Source that needs re-verification after a specific date — e.g. "Re-check FDPIC sectoral guidance after 2026-09-01 (FDPIC publishes annual healthcare guidance update)"}}
- {{Question that emerged during research and warrants its own follow-up}}

## Findings summary (citable from ADRs)

| Q | Finding (one sentence) | Confidence | Feeds |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | {{One-sentence answer — should be quotable verbatim from an ADR}} | {{★★★★}} | {{ADR-NNNN, ADR-MMMM}} |
| Q2 | {{...}} | {{★★★}} | {{ADR-NNNN}} |
| Q3 | {{...}} | {{★★}} | {{TBD — exploratory}} |

<!--
This table is the canonical citation target for ADRs.
ADRs should cite specific cells: `[Research-NNNN §findings Q1](../research/NNNN-slug.md#findings-summary-citable-from-adrs)`
The one-sentence Finding is what gets quoted in the ADR's Decision Outcome section.

## Decisions Anchored

<!--
ONLY populated in Mode 4 Freeze, once the feeding ADRs have landed.
List each landed ADR + the specific findings it cited or overrode.
