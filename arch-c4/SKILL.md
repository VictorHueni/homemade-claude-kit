# C4 model authoring → arc42 §3 / §5 / §7

Single skill, four modes — each owns one arc42 architecture section and the corresponding C4 abstraction level. The Structurizr DSL workspace (`docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl`) is the single source of truth; this skill edits it, renders SVGs via `render.sh`, and writes the arc42 markdown that embeds them.

> "The C4 model is a hierarchical way to think about the static structures of a software system in terms of containers, components, and code." — Simon Brown, [c4model.com](https://c4model.com)

**Prerequisite:** `arch-structurizr init` must have run. If `docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl` doesn't exist, this skill aborts and points the user there.

---

## What this skill is NOT

- **Not a substitute for `domain-model`.** The Building Block View is technical decomposition (containers, components, modules — Spring Boot apps, Postgres databases, Kafka topics). It is **not** a re-statement of the domain model. See `references/boundary-discipline.md` for the three tests that keep them separate.
- **Not the runtime view.** Dynamic scenarios (orchestration across containers, sequence diagrams) belong to `arch-runtime-view` (Milestone 2). This skill only produces **static** views — context, container, component, deployment.
- **Not a one-off renderer.** Every edit goes through `workspace.dsl` so the model stays consistent across views. Direct SVG hand-editing is forbidden — `arch-structurizr verify` will flag drift.

---

## The four modes

Each mode (a) edits `workspace.dsl`, (b) runs `render.sh` to produce one or more SVGs, (c) writes/updates one arc42 markdown file embedding those SVGs.

| Mode | arc42 § | C4 level | DSL view type | View key pattern | Markdown file |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `context` | §3 | Level 1 — System Context | `systemContext` | `systemContext` | `docs/architecture/arc42/03-context.md` |
| `container` | §5.1 | Level 2 — Container | `container` | `containers` | `docs/architecture/arc42/05-building-blocks.md` (§5.1) |
| `component` | §5.2 / §5.3 | Level 3 — Component | `component` | `components-<CON-NN>` | `docs/architecture/arc42/05-building-blocks.md` (one §5.2.x per drilled container) |
| `deployment` | §7 | Deployment | `deployment` | `deployment-<env-slug>` | `docs/architecture/arc42/07-deployment.md` (one §7.x per environment) |

---

## Mode 1 — `context` (arc42 §3, C4 Level 1)

System context: the system being documented + all communication partners (people + external systems). Black-box treatment — internals not shown.

### Pre-flight

1. `docs/architecture/c4/workspace.dsl` exists (else point to `arch-structurizr`).
2. Read `docs/business/01a-personas.md` if present — every Tier-1 persona is a candidate actor. Carry forward `P-NN` IDs.
3. Read `docs/domain/02b-bounded-contexts.md` if present — external systems may correspond to integrations with neighbouring BCs marked `Generic` (commodity, often external SaaS).
4. Read `docs/architecture/interfaces/*.md` if present — externally-facing service contracts indicate which neighbouring systems consume the API.

### Step 0 — Context questions (ask verbatim; user responds with letter codes, e.g. "1A, 2B")

```
1. What is the primary software system this context view documents?
   A. [name a specific system — e.g. "Claims Platform"]
   B. There are multiple in scope — list them and I'll pick one
   C. Re-read VISION.md and propose

2. Source for actor identification?
   A. Personas (business-persona) — all Tier-1 personas become P-NN actors
   B. Process docs (business-process) — extract actors from §Actors
   C. Discovery — describe the actors interactively

3. Source for external systems?
   A. Bounded contexts marked Generic in the BC map
   B. Service contracts (arch-service-contract) — external dependencies listed there
   C. Discovery — describe the external systems interactively
   D. None — the system is standalone

4. Diagram orientation preference?
   A. lr (left-to-right — default for context diagrams)
   B. tb (top-to-bottom — works for 8+ actors)
```

### Fill process

1. Assign the next `SYS-NN` ID to the primary system (or reuse if it exists in the DSL).
2. For each actor: assign `P-NN` (reuse from personas if matched) and add a `person` element with `tags "internal"` or `"external"`.
3. For each external system: assign `SYS-NN` and add a `softwareSystem` with `tags "external"`.
4. Add relationships: typically actor → primary system, primary system ↔ external system. One direction per relationship (Structurizr renders bidirectional as two arrows).
5. Add or update the `systemContext SYS_NN "systemContext"` view block.
6. Run `./docs/architecture/c4/render.sh systemContext` — confirm `views/systemContext.svg` is produced.
7. Generate `docs/architecture/arc42/03-context.md` from `templates/arc42-03-context.md` — embed the rendered SVG; fill §3.1 Business Context table (one row per communication partner) and §3.2 Technical Context table (channels + protocols).
8. Run discipline checks (see `references/c4-model.md` §Quality checks).

---

## Mode 2 — `container` (arc42 §5.1, C4 Level 2)

Zoom inside the primary system: show its containers (deployable runtime units — apps, services, databases, message brokers) and their relationships.

### Pre-flight

1. `arch-structurizr init` has run; `workspace.dsl` exists.
2. Context view exists (`SYS-NN` is in the DSL).
3. Read `docs/domain/02b-bounded-contexts.md` — each BC is a candidate cluster of containers. Microservices typically map 1 BC → 1+ containers; modular monoliths map N BCs → 1 container.
4. Read `docs/product-specs/07a-fbs.md` — `C-N.M.FXX` functionalities hint at which containers exist.

### Step 0 — Context questions

```
1. Container topology?
   A. Microservices — one service per BC
   B. Modular monolith — single deployable, modules per BC
   C. Layered monolith — frontend + backend + DB (BC boundaries are logical, not physical)
   D. Hybrid — I'll describe

2. Database strategy?
   A. One database per service (microservices default)
   B. Shared database (monolith default)
   C. CQRS — separate write + read stores

3. Asynchronous messaging?
   A. Yes, event bus (Kafka / NATS / RabbitMQ / SQS) — add as a queue container
   B. No, synchronous only
   C. Mixed — sync APIs + selected events
```

### Fill process

1. For each container: assign `CON-NN`, choose appropriate tag (`web`, `mobile`, `database`, `queue`, none for plain services), assign technology label (e.g. `"Node.js 20 + Fastify"`, `"PostgreSQL 16"`, `"Kafka 3.7"`).
2. Add containers as nested elements inside `SYS_NN { ... }`.
3. Add inter-container relationships with technology labels (`"HTTPS/JSON"`, `"SQL/TCP"`, `"Kafka protocol"`, etc.).
4. Add or update the `container SYS_NN "containers"` view block.
5. Run `./render.sh containers`.
6. Write/append §5.1 in `docs/architecture/arc42/05-building-blocks.md` — embed `containers.svg`; fill the containers table including the **`Domain aggregates implemented`** column. If a container implements no aggregate (e.g. an event bus), leave the cell empty. The column is mandatory — see `references/boundary-discipline.md`.

---

## Mode 3 — `component` (arc42 §5.2 / §5.3, C4 Level 3)

Drill into **one container** at a time. Each invocation produces a §5.2.x subsection. Stop drilling when the component-level diagram stops being useful (per arc42: "prefer relevance over completeness — leave out normal, simple, boring or standardised parts").

### Pre-flight

1. Container `CON-NN` to drill is supplied.
2. `domain-model` for the BC implementing this container exists at `docs/domain/07b-models/{bc-slug}.md` — components carry `properties.implements` pointing at `BC-NN.AGG-NN` IDs. Abort if missing; recommend running `domain-model` first.

### Step 0 — Context questions

```
1. Which container should I drill into?
   A. [name CON-NN, e.g. "CON-02 Claims API"]
   B. List the containers and let me pick

2. Component discovery basis?
   A. Domain aggregates (BC-NN.AGG-NN) — one component per aggregate's command-handler + query-handler + repository (recommended for Hexagonal / Clean / DDD)
   B. Tech-layer (controller / service / repository) — classic 3-layer split
   C. Existing code — reverse-engineer from src/ structure

3. Component granularity?
   A. Aggregate-level (5–12 components per container — recommended)
   B. Per-endpoint (one component per route — only for small/simple APIs)
   C. Functional cohesion — group by feature
```

### Fill process

1. For each component inside `CON_NN { ... }`: assign `CMP-NN`, give it a technology label, set `properties.implements` to the `BC-NN.AGG-NN` (or several, comma-separated) the component implements.
2. Add intra-container component relationships.
3. Add a `component CON_NN "components-CON-<NN>"` view block.
4. Run `./render.sh components-CON-<NN>`.
5. Append a §5.2.x subsection to `docs/architecture/arc42/05-building-blocks.md` — embed `components-CON-<NN>.svg`; fill the components table including `Domain aggregates implemented` (extracted from `properties.implements`) and optional `Code path` (extracted from `properties.code-path` if set).

---

## Mode 4 — `deployment` (arc42 §7)

Map containers onto infrastructure for one or more environments (dev / staging / production). One deployment view per environment.

### Pre-flight

1. Container view exists (at least one `CON-NN` defined).
2. Read `docs/architecture/decisions/*.md` — infrastructure ADRs (hosting choice, runtime platform, database provisioning, region/zone strategy) are prerequisites. Warn loudly if none exist; let the user proceed only if they confirm.

### Step 0 — Context questions

```
1. Environments to document?
   A. Production only (recommended starting point)
   B. Production + Staging
   C. Production + Staging + Development
   D. Custom list

2. Cloud / infra style?
   A. Single-cloud Kubernetes (e.g. EKS / GKE / AKS)
   B. Serverless (e.g. AWS Lambda + RDS + SQS)
   C. PaaS (e.g. Fly.io / Render / Heroku)
   D. Self-hosted VMs / on-prem
   E. Hybrid — I'll describe

3. Region / zone strategy?
   A. Single region, single AZ
   B. Single region, multi-AZ
   C. Multi-region active-passive
   D. Multi-region active-active
```

### Fill process

1. For each environment: add a `deploymentEnvironment "<Name>" { ... }` block.
2. Inside, build a tree of `deploymentNode` elements (region → AZ → cluster → namespace → pod, or region → service → instance — whatever matches the infra style). Assign `DN-NN` to nodes worth surfacing in the arc42 markdown.
3. Use `containerInstance CON_NN` to place container instances inside their deployment nodes. Reuse the container DSL identifier.
4. Add a `deployment SYS_NN "<Environment>" "deployment-<env-slug>"` view block per environment.
5. Run `./render.sh deployment-<env-slug>`.
6. Write/append §7.x in `docs/architecture/arc42/07-deployment.md` — embed `deployment-<env-slug>.svg`; fill the per-environment table (Motivation, Quality/Performance features, Mapping of building blocks to infrastructure).

---

## DSL editing rules (apply to all four modes)

1. **Forward references are forbidden** — declare every identifier before any relationship that uses it. The `validate` step in `render.sh` catches violations but the skill avoids creating them in the first place.
2. **Identifier convention** — kit IDs (`SYS-NN`, `CON-NN`, `CMP-NN`, `DN-NN`, `P-NN`) use hyphens in display names; DSL identifiers use underscores (`SYS_NN`, `CON_NN`, …). See `arch-structurizr/references/dsl-conventions.md`.
3. **One element per line** — even if the DSL accepts collapsed forms, write one element per line so the kit's audit can grep it.
4. **`properties.implements` is mandatory on every component** — the cross-reference to `domain-model` aggregates. Use `"BC-NN.AGG-NN"` (or a comma-separated list) for domain components; use the sentinel `"none"` for tech-only components (HTTP framework wrappers, generic middleware, observability hooks). Empty string `""` is **not** valid — Structurizr DSL rejects empty property values. Any component missing the `implements` property fails the boundary discipline check.
5. **Tag policy** — apply kit-standard tags only (see `arch-structurizr/references/structurizr-cheatsheet.md` §Tag conventions). Don't invent new tags without updating the styling block.

## Closing report (every mode)

- Mode executed (context / container / component / deployment)
- DSL edits made (number of elements added; new IDs assigned with their kit ID)
- Views rendered (list of `<view-key>.svg` files produced)
- arc42 markdown written / appended (file + section heading)
- Boundary checks: each component's `implements` field validated against `domain-model`; flag any orphan
- Next step suggestion: typically the next mode in the order context → container → component → deployment, or `arch-runtime-view` once enough containers exist
